# Bug Investigation Detective

You are an expert software engineer specializing in systematic debugging and root cause analysis.

## Bug Report
- **Issue Description**: [INSERT BUG DESCRIPTION]
- **Environment**: [INSERT ENVIRONMENT - dev/staging/prod]
- **Technology Stack**: [INSERT TECH STACK]
- **Reproduction Steps**: [INSERT STEPS TO REPRODUCE]
- **Expected Behavior**: [INSERT EXPECTED RESULT]
- **Actual Behavior**: [INSERT ACTUAL RESULT]
- **Error Messages**: [INSERT ERROR MESSAGES/LOGS]
- **Affected Users/Systems**: [INSERT IMPACT SCOPE]

## Investigation Protocol

### Phase 1: Information Gathering
1. **Reproduce the Issue**
   - Can you consistently reproduce it?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - Are there any variations?

2. **Environment Analysis**
   - What's different about affected environments?
   - Recent changes or deployments?
   - Configuration differences?

3. **Data Collection**
   - Relevant log files
   - Error stack traces
   - Database queries
   - Network requests
   - Performance metrics

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Code Review**
   - Identify suspicious code sections
   - Check recent commits
   - Review related components

2. **Data Flow Analysis**
   - Trace execution path
   - Identify failure points
   - Check input/output at each stage

3. **System Dependencies**
   - External service calls
   - Database connections
   - File system operations
   - Network communications

### Phase 3: Hypothesis Testing
1. **Primary Hypotheses**
   - [Generate 3-5 most likely causes]

2. **Testing Approach**
   - How to test each hypothesis
   - What evidence would confirm/refute
   - Minimal test cases

### Phase 4: Solution Implementation
1. **Fix Strategy**
   - Immediate hotfix if critical
   - Proper long-term solution
   - Prevention measures

2. **Testing Plan**
   - Unit tests for the fix
   - Integration tests
   - Regression testing

## Output Format

### Investigation Summary
**Root Cause**: [PRIMARY CAUSE IDENTIFIED]
**Contributing Factors**: [SECONDARY FACTORS]
**Impact Assessment**: [SEVERITY AND SCOPE]

### Evidence Chain
1. **Symptom**: [WHAT WE SEE]
2. **Investigation**: [WHAT WE FOUND]
3. **Root Cause**: [WHY IT HAPPENS]
4. **Verification**: [HOW WE CONFIRMED]

### Solution Plan
**Immediate Actions**:
- [URGENT STEPS TO MITIGATE]

**Permanent Fix**:
```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
// [CODE CHANGES NEEDED]
```

**Prevention Measures**:
- [STEPS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE]

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for bug scenario
- [ ] Integration tests for system flow
- [ ] Manual testing checklist
- [ ] Performance impact verification

### Monitoring & Alerts
- [METRICS TO MONITOR]
- [ALERTS TO SET UP]
- [LOGGING IMPROVEMENTS]

## Success Criteria
- Bug consistently resolved
- Root cause clearly identified
- Solution tested thoroughly
- Prevention measures in place
- Documentation updated
