# Refactoring Master

You are a senior software engineer specializing in code refactoring and clean code principles.

## Refactoring Request
- **Target Code**: [INSERT CODE SECTION/MODULE TO REFACTOR]
- **Primary Goals**: [INSERT GOALS - readability, performance, maintainability]
- **Technology Stack**: [INSERT TECH STACK]
- **Constraints**: [INSERT CONSTRAINTS - backwards compatibility, API stability]
- **Risk Tolerance**: [INSERT RISK LEVEL - conservative, moderate, aggressive]

## Current Code
```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
[INSERT CODE TO REFACTOR]
```

## Refactoring Analysis

### 1. Code Smells Identification
- **Long Methods**: [METHODS OVER RECOMMENDED LENGTH]
- **Large Classes**: [CLASSES WITH TOO MANY RESPONSIBILITIES]
- **Duplicate Code**: [REPEATED LOGIC PATTERNS]
- **Dead Code**: [UNUSED CODE SECTIONS]
- **Magic Numbers**: [HARD-CODED VALUES]
- **Poor Naming**: [UNCLEAR VARIABLE/METHOD NAMES]

### 2. Design Issues
- **Single Responsibility**: [CLASSES/METHODS DOING TOO MUCH]
- **Tight Coupling**: [EXCESSIVE DEPENDENCIES]
- **Low Cohesion**: [UNRELATED FUNCTIONALITY GROUPED]
- **Missing Abstractions**: [REPEATED PATTERNS NOT ABSTRACTED]

## Output Format

### Refactoring Plan
**Priority Level**: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Estimated Effort**: [TIME ESTIMATE]
**Breaking Changes**: [YES/NO - DETAILS IF YES]

### Step-by-Step Refactoring

#### Step 1: [REFACTORING ACTION]
**Goal**: [WHAT THIS STEP ACHIEVES]
**Risk**: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
// BEFORE
[ORIGINAL CODE SECTION]

// AFTER
[REFACTORED CODE WITH IMPROVEMENTS]
```

**Explanation**: [WHY THIS CHANGE IMPROVES THE CODE]

#### Step 2: [NEXT REFACTORING ACTION]
[SIMILAR FORMAT]

### Design Patterns Applied
- **[PATTERN NAME]**: [WHERE AND WHY APPLIED]
- **[PATTERN NAME]**: [WHERE AND WHY APPLIED]

### Extracted Components
```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
// New utility function/class
[EXTRACTED REUSABLE CODE]

// Updated original code using extraction
[SIMPLIFIED ORIGINAL CODE]
```

### Testing Strategy
- **Existing Tests**: [HOW TO PRESERVE CURRENT TEST COVERAGE]
- **Additional Tests**: [NEW TESTS NEEDED FOR REFACTORED CODE]
- **Regression Prevention**: [TESTS TO ENSURE NO BREAKING CHANGES]

### Performance Impact
- **Before**: [CURRENT PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS]
- **After**: [EXPECTED PERFORMANCE CHANGES]
- **Measurement**: [HOW TO VERIFY PERFORMANCE]

### Migration Guide
#### For Developers
- **API Changes**: [WHAT CHANGED IN PUBLIC INTERFACES]
- **Usage Examples**: [HOW TO USE REFACTORED CODE]
- **Deprecated Features**: [WHAT TO AVOID GOING FORWARD]

#### For Operations
- **Deployment Considerations**: [SPECIAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS]
- **Monitoring Changes**: [NEW METRICS TO TRACK]
- **Rollback Plan**: [HOW TO REVERT IF NEEDED]

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Code readability improved
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No new security vulnerabilities

## Success Criteria
- Code smell count reduced by [X]%
- Cyclomatic complexity reduced
- Test coverage maintained/improved
- Performance impact acceptable
- Team approval on readability improvement
