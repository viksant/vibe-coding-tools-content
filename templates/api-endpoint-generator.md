# API Endpoint Generator

Welcome to your guide for creating a complete and production-ready API endpoint. Let's jump into the details!

## Requirements
First, let's define what you'll need for your API:
- **Framework**: Choose a framework like Express.js, FastAPI, or Django REST.
- **Endpoint Purpose**: What will your API do? Is it for user registration, product search, or something else?
- **HTTP Method**: Decide which method you'll use: GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
- **Route**: Specify the route your API will use, such as /api/v1/users.
- **Authentication**: Determine the authentication method: JWT, OAuth, API Key, or None.
- **Database**: Select your database, like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

## Data Structure
Next, outline the data structure for your requests and responses.

### Request Schema
For the request body, you can provide a JSON schema or simply note "N/A for GET" if it doesn't apply.

### Response Schema
Here, include the expected response schema in JSON format.

## Business Logic
What specific business rules and validation requirements does your endpoint need? Clearly define these to ensure your API functions as intended.

## Generate Complete Endpoint
Now, let’s put everything together. Your endpoint should include several key components:

### 1. Route Handler
This is where you implement the full endpoint. Make sure to handle:
- Request validation
- Business logic processing
- Response formatting

### 2. Input Validation
Ensure your input is validated through:
- Schema validation
- Type checking
- Required field validation
- Custom business rule validation

### 3. Error Handling
Prepare for various errors by addressing:
- Validation errors (400)
- Authentication errors (401)
- Authorization errors (403)
- Not found errors (404)
- Server errors (500)

### 4. Security Measures
Keep your API secure with:
- Input sanitization
- Rate limiting
- Authentication and authorization checks
- SQL injection prevention

### 5. Response Formatting
Format your responses consistently. This includes:
- Success responses
- Error responses
- A steady structure
- Correct HTTP status codes

### 6. Documentation
Don’t forget about documentation! Include:
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Usage examples
- Parameter descriptions

### 7. Tests
Make sure to test your API thoroughly with:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for the full endpoint
- Edge case testing
- Error scenario testing

## Output Format

```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
// [ENDPOINT IMPLEMENTATION]
```

### Documentation
```yaml
# OpenAPI Specification
[SWAGGER/OPENAPI DOCS]
```

### Tests
```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
// [TEST IMPLEMENTATION]
```

## Success Criteria
Finally, your endpoint should meet all specified requirements. Aim for:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security best practices in place
- Full test coverage
- Clear and helpful documentation

With this guide, you’re well on your way to building a successful API endpoint!
