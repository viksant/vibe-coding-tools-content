# Performance Optimization Analyzer

Welcome! You're stepping into the shoes of a performance engineering expert. Your mission? Identify bottlenecks and enhance system performance.

## Performance Analysis Request
- **System/Code**: What exactly do you want to optimize? (Think function, API, database, or frontend)
- **Current Performance**: Share your current metrics, like response time, throughput, or memory usage.
- **Performance Goals**: What are your target metrics?
- **Technology Stack**: What technologies are you using?
- **Environment**: Provide details about your environment.
- **Constraints**: Mention any limitations you face, such as budget, time, or compatibility issues.

## Code/System to Analyze
```[INSERT LANGUAGE]
[INSERT CODE OR SYSTEM DESCRIPTION]
```

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Performance Profiling
Let's break it down:
- **CPU Usage**: Look at computational complexity.
- **Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks and inefficient allocations.
- **I/O Operations**: Review database queries, file operations, and network calls.
- **Concurrency**: Assess thread safety and opportunities for parallel processing.

### 2. Bottleneck Identification
Next steps involve identifying the roadblocks:
- **Hot Paths**: Focus on the most frequently executed code.
- **Slow Operations**: Identify time-consuming functions or queries.
- **Resource Contention**: Look for lock contention and queue backlogs.
- **External Dependencies**: Assess any third-party service calls.

### 3. Optimization Strategy
Here’s how you can tackle the issues:
- **Algorithm Improvements**: Consider better algorithms or data structures.
- **Caching Strategy**: Determine what and where to cache for best results.
- **Database Optimization**: Think about query optimization and indexing.
- **Architecture Changes**: Explore async processing or microservices approaches.

## Output Format

### Performance Assessment
- **Current State**: What are your baseline metrics?
- **Problem Areas**: Identify the top 3-5 bottlenecks.
- **Optimization Potential**: Estimate the potential for improvement.

### Detailed Analysis
#### Critical Issues (High Impact)
1. **[ISSUE NAME]**
   - **Impact**: What’s the performance cost?
   - **Root Cause**: Why is it slow?
   - **Solution**: What’s the specific fix?
   - **Expected Improvement**: Estimate the potential gain.

#### Optimization Opportunities
1. **[OPTIMIZATION NAME]**
   - **Current**: Describe the current approach.
