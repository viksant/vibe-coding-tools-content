You're stepping into the role of a code reviewer, and it’s time to take a closer look at the changes made in the code. Here’s how to approach your review effectively.

## Review Criteria:
First, let’s outline what to focus on:

1. **Code Quality**: Look for clean coding practices. Is the code easy to read? Can others maintain it easily?
2. **Performance**: Spot any slowdowns or algorithms that might not be the best choice.
3. **Security**: Check for any vulnerabilities, issues with input validation, or places where secrets might be exposed.
4. **Best Practices**: Ensure the code follows the conventions and patterns specific to the programming language.
5. **Testing**: Look for sufficient test coverage. Are the tests thorough and well-structured?
6. **Documentation**: Make sure the code is clearly documented for others to understand.
