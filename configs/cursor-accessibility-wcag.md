Accessibility configuration focuses on ensuring your project meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This means making your site friendly for users with disabilities by incorporating screen reader support, keyboard navigation, proper color contrast, semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and automated testing.

### Configuration Overview
This setup helps your development environment align with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. It aims to improve accessibility for all users through smart design choices and automated testing.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (version 6 or higher)
- **Cursor IDE** (latest version)
- **Accessibility testing tools** (like Axe or Lighthouse)

### Installation & Setup
Let’s get everything up and running:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - Head to [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer. Follow the instructions for your operating system.

2. **Set up Cursor IDE**:
   - Download and install it from [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.so/).

3. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-accessible-project
   cd my-accessible-project
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install accessibility testing libraries**:
   ```bash
   npm install axe-core jest-axe --save-dev
   ```

5. **Create a basic HTML file**:
   - Set up a file named `index.html` with the following content:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Accessible Project</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   </head>
   <body>
       <header>
           <h1>Welcome to My Accessible Project</h1>
       </header>
       <main>
           <button aria-label="Submit form">Submit</button>
       </main>
       <footer>
           <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@example.com">info@example.com</a></p>
       </footer>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

6. **Create a CSS file**:
   - Make a file called `styles.css` and add this code:
   ```css
   body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       color: #333;
       background-color: #fff;
   }
   button {
       background-color: #007BFF;
       color: white;
       border: none;
       padding: 10px 20px;
       cursor: pointer;
   }
   button:focus {
       outline: 2px solid #0056b3;
   }
   ```

7. **Set up automated accessibility testing**:
   - Create a file named `accessibility.test.js` and include the following:
   ```javascript
   import { toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';
   import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
   import MyComponent from './MyComponent'; // Replace with your component

   expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

   test('should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
       const { container } = render(<MyComponent />);
       const results = await axe(container);
       expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
   });
   ```

### File Structure
Here’s how your project should look:
```
my-accessible-project/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── accessibility.test.js
└── package.json
```

### Key Configuration Files
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that uses a semantic structure and ARIA attributes.
- **`styles.css`**: The stylesheet that ensures good color contrast and focus states.
- **`accessibility.test.js`**: The script for running automated accessibility checks.

### Advanced Options
If you want to take things further, consider these options:
- **Custom ARIA roles**: These can help improve navigation for screen reader users.
- **Color contrast tools**: Use tools like Contrast Checker to confirm your colors meet the standards.
- **Keyboard navigation**: Add `tabindex` to custom components so they are keyboard accessible.

### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, here are some tips:
- **Screen reader not reading content**: Check that ARIA attributes are applied correctly, and ensure your HTML structure is semantic.
- **Color contrast problems**: Use the Color Contrast Analyzer to verify compliance with WCAG guidelines.
- **Automated tests failing**: Review your component structure and make sure all interactive elements are focusable.

### Best Practices
To keep your project accessible, try these strategies:
- Regularly test with users who rely on assistive technologies.
- Keep your HTML semantic by using elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Use clear link text and button labels for better context.
- Ensure a consistent focus order for keyboard navigation.

### Performance Tuning and Workflow Tips
Here are a few ways to streamline your work:
- Minimize unnecessary ARIA attributes; use them only when native HTML elements fall short.
- Use CSS variables to keep your color schemes consistent throughout your project.
- Regularly update your accessibility testing tools to benefit from the latest features and improvements.
