Unity game development configuration featuring C# scripting patterns, physics simulation, animation systems, UI toolkit, cross-platform deployment, addressable asset system, and performance optimization for mobile and desktop platforms.

### Configuration Overview
This setup enables efficient Unity game development using OpenAI Codex, focusing on C# scripting, physics, UI, and cross-platform deployment.

### Prerequisites
- **Unity**: Version 2021.3 or later
- **OpenAI Codex**: Access to OpenAI API
- **C#**: Basic understanding of C# programming
- **Visual Studio**: Version 2019 or later with Unity tools
- **Git**: Version control for project management

### Installation & Setup
1. **Install Unity**: Download and install Unity Hub, then install the latest LTS version of Unity.
2. **Create a New Project**: Open Unity Hub, click on "New Project", select "3D", and name your project.
3. **Set Up OpenAI Codex**:
   - Create an account at OpenAI and obtain your API key.
   - In Unity, create a new folder named `Scripts` in the `Assets` directory.
   - Create a new C# script named `OpenAICodexManager.cs` and add the following code:
   ```csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using System.Net.Http;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;

   public class OpenAICodexManager : MonoBehaviour {
       private static readonly HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
       private string apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

       public async Task<string> GenerateCode(string prompt) {
           client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", apiKey);
           var response = await client.PostAsync("https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions", new StringContent("{\"prompt\":\"" + prompt + "\",\"max_tokens\":100}"));
           return await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Configure Physics Settings**:
   - Go to `Edit > Project Settings > Physics` and adjust settings like gravity and collision detection based on your game requirements.
5. **Set Up Addressables**:
   - Install the Addressables package via `Window > Package Manager`.
   - Create an `Addressables` folder in `Assets`, and mark assets for addressable management.
6. **Implement UI Toolkit**:
   - Install the UI Toolkit package via `Window > Package Manager`.
   - Create a new `UI` folder in `Assets` and design your UI using the UI Builder tool.

### File Structure

```

### Key Configuration Files
- `OpenAICodexManager.cs`: Manages API calls to OpenAI Codex.
- `AddressablesSettings.asset`: Configures addressable assets.
- `InputSettings.asset`: Configures input settings for the new Input System.

### Advanced Options
- **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use `Addressables` for loading assets asynchronously.
   - Implement object pooling for frequently instantiated objects.
   - Optimize physics settings by adjusting collision layers and using simplified colliders.
- **Custom Scripting Patterns**:
   - Use ScriptableObjects for data management.
   - Implement event-driven programming for better decoupling.

### Troubleshooting
- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
- **Unity Crashes**: Check for incompatible packages or scripts causing runtime errors.
- **Addressables Not Loading**: Verify that assets are marked as addressable and check the Addressables settings.

### Best Practices
- **Version Control**: Use Git for tracking changes and collaborating with team members.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your code and project structure.
- **Testing**: Regularly test your game on target platforms to identify performance bottlenecks.

### Performance Tuning
- **Quality Settings**: Adjust quality settings based on target platform capabilities.
- **Profiling**: Use Unity Profiler to identify performance issues during gameplay.
- **Build Settings**: Optimize build settings for target platforms, enabling IL2CPP for better performance on mobile.

### Workflow Optimization Tips
- **Automate Builds**: Use Unity Cloud Build for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Editor Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with Unity Editor shortcuts to speed up development.
- **Asset Management**: Regularly clean up unused assets to reduce project size and improve load times.
