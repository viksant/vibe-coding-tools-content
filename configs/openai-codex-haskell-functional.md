This guide walks you through setting up OpenAI Codex to work with Haskell functional programming, focusing on advanced type systems and testing tools.

### Configuration Overview
We're looking at a setup that helps you develop in Haskell while embracing functional programming principles. This means you'll make good use of strong type systems, monads, lazy evaluation, algebraic data types, property-based testing with QuickCheck, and parser combinators using the Parsec library.

### Prerequisites
Before you dive in, make sure you have these tools ready:
- **Haskell Platform**: Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) version 8.10 or higher.
- **Cabal**: You'll need the package manager for Haskell, version 3.2 or higher.
- **Stack**: This is the Haskell build tool, so grab version 2.5 or higher.
- **QuickCheck**: For property-based testing.
- **Parsec**: For working with parser combinators.

### Installation & Setup
Let’s get everything installed step by step:

1. **Install GHC**: Check out the instructions at [GHC Downloads](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download.html).
2. **Install Cabal**: Run these commands:
   ```bash
   cabal update
   cabal install cabal-install
   ```
3. **Install Stack**: You can install it with this command:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
   ```
4. **Create a new Stack project**:
   ```bash
   stack new my-haskell-project
   cd my-haskell-project
   ```
5. **Add dependencies to `stack.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   extra-deps:
     - QuickCheck-2.14.2
     - parsec-3.1.14.0
   ```
6. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   stack setup
   stack build
   ```

### File Structure
Here's how your project should look:
```
my-haskell-project/
├── app/
│   └── Main.hs
├── src/
│   └── MyModule.hs
├── test/
│   └── MyModuleSpec.hs
├── stack.yaml
└── package.yaml
```

### Key Configuration Files
- **`stack.yaml`**: This is your Stack configuration file.
  ```yaml
  resolver: lts-18.0
  packages:
    - .
  extra-deps:
    - QuickCheck-2.14.2
    - parsec-3.1.14.0
  ```
- **`package.yaml`**: This file contains package configuration.
  ```yaml
  name: my-haskell-project
  version: 0.1.0.0
  library:
    source-dirs: src
  executables:
    my-haskell-project-exe:
      main: Main.hs
      source-dirs: app
  tests:
    my-module-test:
      main: MyModuleSpec.hs
      source-dirs: test
  ```

### Advanced Options
Want to take it a step further? Here are some advanced options:
- **Enable GHC Extensions**: Add this to the top of your Haskell files to use advanced features:
  ```haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
  {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
  ```
- **Optimize for performance**: Use the `-O2` flag during builds:
  ```bash
  stack build --ghc-options="-O2"
  ```

### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, here are some quick fixes:
- **GHC not found**: Make sure GHC is installed and included in your PATH.
- **Dependency issues**: Try running `stack build` again to fix any missing dependencies.
- **Compilation errors**: Check your Haskell files for any syntax errors or missing imports.

### Best Practices
To keep your code clean and reliable, consider these tips:
- **Use type annotations**: This makes your code more readable and helps you leverage Haskell's type system effectively.
- **Modularize code**: Break larger modules into smaller, reusable components.
- **Write tests**: Use QuickCheck for property-based testing to ensure your code works as expected.

### Performance Tuning and Workflow Optimization Tips
Here are some final tips to streamline your workflow:
- **Use `stack ghci`**: This command helps you with interactive development and testing of Haskell code.
- **Leverage Cabal's `cabal new-build`**: It speeds up builds and improves dependency management.
- **Profile your code**: Use GHC's profiling tools to spot bottlenecks in your application.
