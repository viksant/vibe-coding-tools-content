This configuration improves your Cursor setup to boost web application performance, specifically focusing on Core Web Vitals.

### Configuration Overview
With this setup, you can enhance your web application's performance. It optimizes Core Web Vitals by reducing bundle sizes, implementing lazy loading, optimizing images, and improving caching mechanisms.

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **Cursor IDE**: The latest version
- **Webpack**: Version 5.x
- **Lighthouse**: Installed as a Chrome extension for performance audits

### Installation & Setup
Let's get started with the installation and setup:

1. **Install Node.js**: Head over to [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it.
2. **Set up Cursor IDE**: Follow the installation instructions found on the [Cursor IDE website](https://cursor.so/).
3. **Initialize your project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-web-app
   cd my-web-app
   npm init -y
   ```
4. **Install Webpack and necessary plugins**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-bundle-analyzer image-webpack-loader
   ```
5. **Create a `webpack.config.js` file** in the root of your project:
   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');
   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/index.js',
     output: {
       filename: 'bundle.js',
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
     },
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif)$/i,
           use: [
             {
               loader: 'image-webpack-loader',
               options: {
                 mozjpeg: {
                   progressive: true,
                   quality: 65
                 },
                 // Additional image optimization options
               },
             },
           ],
         },
       ],
     },
     optimization: {
       splitChunks: {
         chunks: 'all',
       },
     },
   };
   ```
6. **Create a basic project structure**:
   ```
   my-web-app/
   ├── dist/
   ├── src/
   │   ├── index.js
   │   └── styles.css
   ├── webpack.config.js
   └── package.json
   ```

### Key Configuration Files
- **`webpack.config.js`**: This is your main configuration file for Webpack.
- **`package.json`**: This file contains your project metadata and dependencies.

### Advanced Options
You can take your setup further with these advanced options:
- **Lazy Loading**: Add dynamic imports in your `index.js` like this:
   ```javascript
   import('./module.js').then(module => {
     // Use the module
   });
   ```
- **Image Optimization**: Set up `image-webpack-loader` to compress images during the build process.
- **Caching**: Consider using service workers to cache static assets.

### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, here are some quick fixes:
- **Webpack build fails**: Look for any syntax errors in your configuration files and ensure you have installed all dependencies.
- **Images not loading**: Double-check the paths in your `src` directory and confirm that the image loader is set up correctly.
- **Performance issues**: Use Lighthouse to audit your application and pinpoint any bottlenecks.

### Best Practices
Follow these suggestions to keep your project running smoothly:
- **Minimize bundle size**: Regularly analyze your bundle using `webpack-bundle-analyzer`:
   ```bash
   npx webpack --profile --json > stats.json
   npx webpack-bundle-analyzer stats.json
   ```
- **Use modern JavaScript features**: Take advantage of ES6+ syntax for clearer, more efficient code.
- **Regularly test performance**: Use Lighthouse to keep an eye on Core Web Vitals and adjust as needed.

### Performance Tuning and Workflow Optimization Tips
Here are some tips to further enhance your setup:
- **Enable Gzip compression**: Configure your server to serve compressed files.
- **Use a CDN**: Serve static assets from a Content Delivery Network for quicker load times.
- **Monitor memory usage**: Use Chrome DevTools to profile your application and identify any memory leaks.
