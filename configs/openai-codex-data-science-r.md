This configuration helps you set up OpenAI Codex for data science and statistical analysis using R and the tidyverse ecosystem.

### Configuration Overview
With this setup, you can handle data manipulation, create visualizations, conduct statistical modeling, build machine learning models, and develop web applications using R. It offers a complete environment for your data science projects.

### Prerequisites
Before diving in, make sure you have:
- R (version 4.0 or higher)
- RStudio (the latest version is best)
- OpenAI Codex API access
- These R packages: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `caret`, `shiny`, `rmarkdown`, `tidymodels`

### Installation & Setup
Let's get started with the installation:

1. **Install R**: Head over to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) to download and install R.
2. **Install RStudio**: Download RStudio from [RStudio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. **Install Required Packages**: Open R or RStudio and run these commands:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "caret", "shiny", "rmarkdown", "tidymodels"))
   ```
4. **Set Up OpenAI Codex**: Make sure you have access to the OpenAI Codex API, and set your API key in your environment:
   ```r
   Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here")
   ```

### File Structure
Here’s a suggested file structure for your project:
```
/data-science-project
├── data
│   ├── raw
│   ├── processed
├── scripts
│   ├── data_preparation.R
│   ├── analysis.R
│   ├── model_training.R
├── reports
│   ├── report.Rmd
├── app
│   ├── app.R
├── README.md
```

### Key Configuration Files
Now, let's look at some key files in your project:

- **`data_preparation.R`**: This script loads and cleans your data.
  ```r
  library(tidyverse)
  data <- read_csv("data/raw/data.csv") %>%
    clean_names() %>%
    filter(!is.na(target_variable))
  ```

- **`analysis.R`**: This script handles exploratory data analysis.
  ```r
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(data, aes(x = variable1, y = target_variable)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal()
  ```

- **`model_training.R`**: This script trains your machine learning models.
  ```r
  library(caret)
  model <- train(target_variable ~ ., data = data, method = "rf")
  saveRDS(model, "model/rf_model.rds")
  ```

- **`app.R`**: This is your Shiny application file.
  ```r
  library(shiny)
  ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Data Science App"),
    sidebarLayout(
      sidebarPanel(
        selectInput("variable", "Variable:", choices = names(data))
      ),
      mainPanel(
        plotOutput("plot")
      )
    )
  )
  server <- function(input, output) {
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      ggplot(data, aes_string(x = input$variable, y = "target_variable")) + geom_point()
    })
  }
  shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
  ```

- **`report.Rmd`**: This is an R Markdown file for generating reports.
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: "Data Analysis Report"
  output: html_document
  ---
  
  ```{r}
  library(ggplot2)
  # Analysis code here
  ```

### Advanced Options
Want to boost your project? Check out these advanced options:

- **Performance Tuning**: Use the `data.table` package for quicker data manipulation, especially with large datasets.
- **Parallel Processing**: Speed up model training with the `doParallel` package.
  ```r
  library(doParallel)
  cl <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)
  registerDoParallel(cl)
  ```

### Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, here are some quick tips:

- **Package Installation Issues**: Make sure R is updated and check for any missing dependencies.
- **API Key Errors**: Double-check that your API key is correctly set in your environment.
- **Shiny App Not Running**: Look for missing libraries and ensure that your working directory is set right.

### Best Practices
Keep your project organized and efficient with these best practices:

- **Version Control**: Use Git to manage versions of your project files.
- **Documentation**: Keep clear documentation in your `README.md` to guide users on setup and usage.
- **Reproducibility**: Use R Markdown for analyses to ensure that others can reproduce your results.

### Performance Optimization Tips
Want to make your project run smoother? Here are some tips:

- **Data Loading**: Use `readr` functions for faster data loading.
- **Model Selection**: Use `caret`'s `trainControl` for cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- **Profiling**: Use the `profvis` package to pinpoint bottlenecks in your code.
