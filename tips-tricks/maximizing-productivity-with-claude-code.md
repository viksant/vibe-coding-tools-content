# Maximizing Productivity with Claude Code

## Quick Tips for Efficient AI-Assisted Development

### 1. Use Descriptive Prompts
Always provide clear, specific prompts to get better AI assistance:
```
❌ "Fix this code"
✅ "Optimize this React component for performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders"
```

### 2. Leverage Context Awareness
Claude Code understands your project context - reference files and patterns:
- Mention specific files when asking for changes
- Reference existing patterns in your codebase
- Ask for consistency with current architecture

### 3. Iterative Development
Work in small, focused iterations:
- Request one feature at a time
- Test each change before moving forward
- Build complexity gradually

### 4. Code Review Integration
Use Claude Code for thorough code reviews:
- Ask for security vulnerability assessments
- Request performance optimization suggestions
- Get feedback on code maintainability

### 5. Learning and Documentation
Transform Claude Code into your learning partner:
- Ask for explanations of complex code
- Request best practice recommendations
- Generate documentation for your functions

## Pro Tips
- Use keyboard shortcuts for faster interaction
- Save frequently used prompts as templates
- Combine multiple requests in a single prompt for related changes
