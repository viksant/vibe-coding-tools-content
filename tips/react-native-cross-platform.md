To get React Native code that works well on both iOS and Android, it's important to focus on cross-platform solutions that consider the differences between the two systems and enhance performance. This helps make sure your mobile app runs smoothly everywhere.

1. **Clearly outline your needs**: Let the developer know what features you want and emphasize that they should work on both platforms. 
   - For example: "I need a login screen that supports both iOS and Android."

2. **Address platform-specific differences**: Ask for code that uses conditional rendering or checks for the platform.
   - Here's a code snippet: 
     ```javascript
     import { Platform } from 'react-native';
     const styles = Platform.select({
       ios: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
       android: { backgroundColor: 'green' },
     });
     ```

3. **Ask about native modules**: Make sure the developer uses native modules when needed for better performance.
   - For instance: "Please include native modules for camera access on both platforms."

4. **Request performance optimization**: Emphasize the need for optimized code that focuses on load times and responsiveness for both platforms.
   - An example request could be: "Make sure to optimize images and assets for both iOS and Android."

5. **Request documentation**: Ensure the code comes with clear instructions on how to implement and test it on both platforms.
   - You might say: "Please provide setup instructions for both iOS and Android environments."

By following these steps, you can expect to receive a well-organized React Native codebase that functions efficiently across both platforms.

### Why This Works
This approach helps developers grasp your need for a true cross-platform solution. It makes the most of React Native's ability to address platform-specific details while keeping performance high. Use these suggestions when kicking off a new project or improving an existing app.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```javascript
  const styles = { backgroundColor: 'blue' }; // Only for iOS
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```javascript
  const styles = Platform.select({
    ios: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
    android: { backgroundColor: 'green' },
  });
  ```
- **Before**: 
  ```javascript
  // No native module for camera
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```javascript
  import { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera'; // Using native module
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not mentioning platform differences**: Always highlight the need for handling variations between iOS and Android.
  - Solution: Use `Platform.select` for styling and functionality.
  
- **Neglecting performance optimization**: If you donâ€™t request performance considerations, the app may run slowly.
  - Solution: Ask for asset optimization and effective coding practices.

- **Omitting documentation**: Receiving code without guidance can create implementation headaches.
  - Solution: Always request detailed documentation with the code.

- **Ignoring native modules**: Not incorporating native modules can limit app capabilities.
  - Solution: Specify the need for native modules for features like camera or GPS.
