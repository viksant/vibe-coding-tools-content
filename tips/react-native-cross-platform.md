To efficiently request React Native code that works seamlessly on both iOS and Android, focus on specifying cross-platform solutions that address platform-specific differences and optimize performance. This ensures your mobile app runs smoothly on both operating systems.

1. **Define your requirements clearly**: Specify the features you need and mention that they should work on both platforms.
   - Example: "I need a login screen that supports both iOS and Android."

2. **Request handling of platform-specific differences**: Ask for code that uses conditional rendering or platform checks.
   - Code: 
     ```javascript
     import { Platform } from 'react-native';
     const styles = Platform.select({
       ios: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
       android: { backgroundColor: 'green' },
     });
     ```

3. **Inquire about native modules**: Ensure that the developer uses native modules where necessary for performance.
   - Example: "Please include native modules for camera access on both platforms."

4. **Ask for performance optimization**: Request that the code is optimized for both platforms, focusing on load times and responsiveness.
   - Example: "Make sure to optimize images and assets for both iOS and Android."

5. **Request documentation**: Ensure the code comes with clear documentation on how to implement and test on both platforms.
   - Example: "Please provide setup instructions for both iOS and Android environments."

Expected result: You will receive a well-structured React Native codebase that functions efficiently across both iOS and Android platforms.

### Why It Works
This approach ensures that developers understand your needs for a truly cross-platform solution, leveraging React Native's capabilities to handle platform-specific nuances while maintaining performance. Use this when starting a new project or enhancing an existing app.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```javascript
  const styles = { backgroundColor: 'blue' }; // Only for iOS
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```javascript
  const styles = Platform.select({
    ios: { backgroundColor: 'blue' },
    android: { backgroundColor: 'green' },
  });
  ```
- **Before**: 
  ```javascript
  // No native module for camera
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```javascript
  import { RNCamera } from 'react-native-camera'; // Using native module
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying platform differences**: Always mention the need for handling iOS and Android variations.
  - Fix: Use `Platform.select` for styling and functionality.
  
- **Ignoring performance optimization**: Failing to request performance considerations can lead to slow apps.
  - Fix: Ask for asset optimization and efficient coding practices.

- **Lack of documentation**: Receiving code without instructions can lead to implementation issues.
  - Fix: Always request comprehensive documentation with the code.

- **Overlooking native modules**: Not using native modules can hinder app functionality.
  - Fix: Specify the need for native modules for features like camera or GPS.
