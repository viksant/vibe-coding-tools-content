Using ES6+ features in JavaScript can really boost how readable and maintainable your code is. By embracing modern syntax, you can write cleaner code that’s easier to understand. Let’s break down some steps to effectively use ES6+ features in your coding.

1. **Specify the ES6+ features** you want to include in your prompt. This could be arrow functions, destructuring, or template literals. 
   - For example, you might say: `Write a function using arrow syntax and destructuring to sum an array of numbers.`

2. **Use template literals** for string interpolation instead of sticking to concatenation. 
   - Here’s how it looks: 
     ```javascript
     const name = 'John';
     const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
     ```
   - This gives you: `Hello, John!`

3. **Implement async/await** to manage asynchronous operations more smoothly.
   - Check out this example:
     ```javascript
     const fetchData = async () => {
       const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       const data = await response.json();
       return data;
     };
     ```
   - This approach makes promise handling much simpler.

4. **Utilize destructuring** to easily extract values from arrays or objects.
   - Here’s a quick snippet:
     ```javascript
     const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
     const { name, age } = user;
     ```
   - Now you can access `name` and `age` directly.

5. **Request examples** that incorporate these features in your prompts to see how they work in practice.
   - For instance, you could ask: `Show me how to use async/await with fetch and destructuring.`

### Why It Works
Using ES6+ features results in more concise and expressive code. This makes it easier to read and maintain, which is especially handy in team settings or when you revisit your code after some time.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**:
  ```javascript
  function sum(arr) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      total += arr[i];
    }
    return total;
  }
  ```
- **After**:
  ```javascript
  const sum = arr => arr.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
  ```

- **Before**:
  ```javascript
  const user = { name: 'Bob', age: 30 };
  const name = user.name;
  const age = user.age;
  ```
- **After**:
  ```javascript
  const { name, age } = user;
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying ES6+ features** in prompts can lead to confusion. Always include the features you want to see.
- **Using old syntax** can hold you back. Stick to modern arrow functions when possible.
- **Neglecting error handling** with async/await is a pitfall. Always include try/catch blocks to manage errors effectively.
- **Overusing destructuring** can make your code harder to read. Keep it clear and simple to maintain clarity.
