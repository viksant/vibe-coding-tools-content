Using ES6+ features in JavaScript prompts enhances code readability and maintainability. By requesting modern syntax, you can write cleaner and more efficient code. Follow these steps to leverage ES6+ features effectively:

1. **Specify the ES6+ features** you want in your prompt. For example, mention arrow functions, destructuring, or template literals.
   - Example prompt: `Write a function using arrow syntax and destructuring to sum an array of numbers.`
   
2. **Use template literals** for string interpolation instead of concatenation.
   - Code: 
     ```javascript
     const name = 'John';
     const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
     ```
   - This results in: `Hello, John!`

3. **Implement async/await** for handling asynchronous operations.
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     const fetchData = async () => {
       const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       const data = await response.json();
       return data;
     };
     ```
   - This simplifies handling promises.

4. **Utilize destructuring** to extract values from arrays or objects easily.
   - Code:
     ```javascript
     const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
     const { name, age } = user;
     ```
   - This allows direct access to `name` and `age`.

5. **Request examples** that incorporate these features in your prompts to see practical implementations.
   - Example prompt: `Show me how to use async/await with fetch and destructuring.`

### Why It Works
Using ES6+ features leads to more concise and expressive code, making it easier to read and maintain. This is particularly useful in collaborative environments or when revisiting code after some time.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**:
  ```javascript
  function sum(arr) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      total += arr[i];
    }
    return total;
  }
  ```
- **After**:
  ```javascript
  const sum = arr => arr.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
  ```

- **Before**:
  ```javascript
  const user = { name: 'Bob', age: 30 };
  const name = user.name;
  const age = user.age;
  ```
- **After**:
  ```javascript
  const { name, age } = user;
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying ES6+ features** in prompts: Always include the features you want.
- **Using old syntax**: Avoid traditional function expressions when arrow functions are preferred.
- **Neglecting error handling** with async/await: Always include try/catch blocks for better error management.
- **Overusing destructuring**: Ensure clarity; destructuring too deeply can reduce readability.
