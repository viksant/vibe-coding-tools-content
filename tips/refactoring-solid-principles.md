To improve code maintainability, request code refactoring using SOLID principles. This approach ensures that your code is cleaner and easier to manage. 

1. **Identify the code** that needs refactoring. 
   - Example: A class that handles multiple responsibilities.
2. **Draft a request** for refactoring that specifies the SOLID principles. 
   - Use this template: "Please refactor the [ClassName] to adhere to SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion."
3. **Provide examples** of how the code can be improved. 
   - For instance, suggest breaking down a large class into smaller, single-responsibility classes.
4. **Set a timeline** for the refactoring process to ensure timely updates. 
   - Example: "Could you complete this by [date]?"
5. **Review the refactored code** to ensure it meets the SOLID principles. 
   - Check that each class now has a single responsibility and that dependencies are inverted.

Expected result: You will receive cleaner, more maintainable code that adheres to SOLID principles.

### WHY IT WORKS
Using SOLID principles enhances code structure, making it easier to understand, test, and modify. This is particularly useful in large projects where maintainability is crucial.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  class UserManager:
      def create_user(self, user_data):
          # Logic to create user
      def send_email(self, user_email):
          # Logic to send email
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  class UserCreator:
      def create_user(self, user_data):
          # Logic to create user

  class EmailSender:
      def send_email(self, user_email):
          # Logic to send email
  ```
- **Request**: "Please refactor UserManager to separate user creation and email sending into UserCreator and EmailSender."

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not specifying all SOLID principles**: Always mention all five principles in your request.
- **Vague requests**: Be specific about which classes or methods need refactoring.
- **Ignoring testing**: Ensure that tests are updated or created for the refactored code.
- **Setting unrealistic timelines**: Provide a reasonable deadline based on the complexity of the code.
