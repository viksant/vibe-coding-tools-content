To make your code easier to maintain, consider requesting a refactor using SOLID principles. This method helps you create cleaner and more manageable code.

1. **Identify the code** that needs a makeover. 
   - For example, look for a class that takes on too many responsibilities.
   
2. **Draft a request** for the refactor that highlights the SOLID principles. 
   - You can use this template: "Please refactor the [ClassName] to follow SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion."

3. **Provide examples** of potential improvements. 
   - For instance, suggest splitting a large class into smaller classes that each focus on a single responsibility.

4. **Set a timeline** for the refactoring process to keep things on track. 
   - You might say, "Could you finish this by [date]?"

5. **Review the refactored code** to confirm it aligns with the SOLID principles. 
   - Make sure each class has a single responsibility and that dependencies are inverted properly.

Following this process should give you cleaner, more maintainable code that sticks to SOLID principles.

### Why This Works
Using SOLID principles improves your code structure, making it easier to understand, test, and modify. This approach is especially beneficial for larger projects where maintaining code quality is essential.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  class UserManager:
      def create_user(self, user_data):
          # Logic to create user
      def send_email(self, user_email):
          # Logic to send email
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  class UserCreator:
      def create_user(self, user_data):
          # Logic to create user

  class EmailSender:
      def send_email(self, user_email):
          # Logic to send email
  ```
- **Request**: "Please refactor UserManager to separate user creation and email sending into UserCreator and EmailSender."

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying all SOLID principles**: Always include all five principles in your request.
- **Vague requests**: Be clear about which classes or methods you want to be refactored.
- **Ignoring testing**: Make sure to update or create tests for the new code.
- **Setting unrealistic timelines**: Choose a deadline that reflects the complexity of the code.
