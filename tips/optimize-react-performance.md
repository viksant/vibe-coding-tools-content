To enhance the performance of your React components, specify optimization requirements when requesting code. This approach ensures that your components utilize techniques like memoization and optimized callbacks, leading to improved rendering efficiency.

1. **Identify performance needs**: Determine which components are slow and what optimizations are necessary (e.g., memoization, callback optimization).
2. **Request specific optimizations**: When asking for code, explicitly mention the use of `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.
3. **Provide context**: Share details about the component's props and state management to guide the optimization.
4. **Review the generated code**: Ensure that the optimizations are correctly implemented and fit your use case.
5. **Test performance**: Use React's Profiler to measure the performance improvements after implementing the optimized code.

Expected result: You will receive optimized React components that enhance performance through effective rendering strategies.

### WHY IT WORKS
This method leverages React's built-in performance features, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving the overall user experience. Use this approach when dealing with complex components or large applications where performance is critical.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: 
```javascript
function MyComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}</div>;
}
```
- **After**: 
```javascript
const Item = React.memo(({ id, name }) => <div>{name}</div>);

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  const memoizedData = useMemo(() => data, [data]);
  return <div>{memoizedData.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}</div>;
}
```
- **Before**: 
```javascript
function handleClick() {
  console.log('Clicked');
}
```
- **After**: 
```javascript
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log('Clicked');
}, []);
```

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not using memoization**: Failing to wrap components with `React.memo` can lead to unnecessary re-renders. **Fix**: Always wrap components that receive props that change frequently.
- **Overusing `useMemo` and `useCallback`**: Applying these hooks everywhere can add complexity without benefits. **Fix**: Use them only when performance issues are identified.
- **Ignoring dependencies**: Forgetting to include dependencies in `useMemo` or `useCallback` can lead to stale data. **Fix**: Always list all variables that affect the computation.
- **Neglecting testing**: Not measuring performance before and after optimizations can lead to unverified improvements. **Fix**: Use React's Profiler to track performance changes.
