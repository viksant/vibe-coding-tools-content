To improve type safety in your TypeScript projects, remember to ask for type definitions whenever you request code snippets. This way, you'll get code that not only works but also fits perfectly with TypeScript's strict typing requirements.

1. **Be clear in your request**: When you ask for code, make sure to include a request for type definitions.
   - For example, you could say: `Can you provide a TypeScript function that fetches user data and includes the type definitions?`
   
2. **Request specific interfaces and types**: Along with the code, ask for any relevant interfaces or types.
   - A good prompt might be: `Please include an interface for the user object in your response.`
   
3. **Ask about generics**: If it makes sense for your situation, don’t hesitate to ask for generic constraints to keep your options open.
   - You could ask: `Can you make the function generic to handle different data types?`
   
4. **Review the code you receive**: After you get the code, check that it includes type definitions that meet your needs.
   - Look for keywords like `interface`, `type`, or `generic` to ensure they are present.

5. **Test the code**: Implement what you've received in your TypeScript environment to confirm its type safety.
   - Use the command: `tsc yourFile.ts` to compile the code and check for any type errors.

By following these steps, you’ll end up with TypeScript code that includes proper type definitions, which boosts type safety and enhances your overall development experience.

### WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS
Requesting type definitions helps ensure that the code fits into TypeScript's type system, which cuts down on runtime errors and makes your code more maintainable. Use this method when adding new code snippets or libraries to your TypeScript projects.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: `Can you show me a function to get user data?`
- **After**: `Can you provide a TypeScript function to fetch user data, including the type definitions for the user object?`
  
- **Before**: `Write a function that returns a list of products.`
- **After**: `Write a TypeScript function that returns a list of products, including an interface for the product type.`

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not specifying type definitions**: Always include a request for types in your prompt.
  - **Fix**: Add “with type definitions” to your request.
  
- **Ignoring generics**: Forgetting to ask for generics can limit code flexibility.
  - **Fix**: Include “make it generic” in your prompt if needed.
  
- **Overlooking type errors**: Failing to test the code for type safety can lead to issues.
  - **Fix**: Always compile the code using `tsc` to catch errors.
  
- **Assuming default types**: Relying on default types may result in unexpected behavior.
  - **Fix**: Specify the exact types you need in your request.
