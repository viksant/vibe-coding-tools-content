To enhance type safety in your TypeScript projects, always request type definitions when asking for code snippets. This ensures that the code you receive is not only functional but also adheres to TypeScript's strict typing system.

1. **Specify your request clearly**: When asking for code, include a request for type definitions.
   - Example prompt: `Can you provide a TypeScript function that fetches user data and include the type definitions?`
   
2. **Ask for interfaces and types**: Request specific interfaces or types to be defined alongside the code.
   - Example prompt: `Please include an interface for the user object in your response.`
   
3. **Inquire about generics**: If applicable, ask for generic constraints to ensure flexibility.
   - Example prompt: `Can you make the function generic to handle different data types?`
   
4. **Review the provided code**: Check the code for the presence of type definitions and ensure they match your requirements.
   - Look for `interface`, `type`, or `generic` keywords in the response.
   
5. **Test the code**: Implement the code in your TypeScript environment to verify type safety.
   - Use the command: `tsc yourFile.ts` to compile and check for type errors.

Expected result: You will receive TypeScript code with proper type definitions, enhancing type safety and improving your development experience.

### WHY IT WORKS
Requesting type definitions ensures that the code adheres to TypeScript's type system, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability. Use this approach when integrating new code snippets or libraries into your TypeScript projects.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: `Can you show me a function to get user data?`
- **After**: `Can you provide a TypeScript function to fetch user data, including the type definitions for the user object?`
  
- **Before**: `Write a function that returns a list of products.`
- **After**: `Write a TypeScript function that returns a list of products, including an interface for the product type.`

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not specifying type definitions**: Always include a request for types in your prompt.
  - **Fix**: Add “with type definitions” to your request.
  
- **Ignoring generics**: Forgetting to ask for generics can limit code flexibility.
  - **Fix**: Include “make it generic” in your prompt if needed.
  
- **Overlooking type errors**: Failing to test the code for type safety.
  - **Fix**: Always compile the code using `tsc` to catch errors.
  
- **Assuming default types**: Relying on default types may lead to unexpected behavior.
  - **Fix**: Specify the exact types you need in your request.
