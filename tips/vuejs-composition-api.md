To boost code reusability and maintainability in Vue.js, focus on examples that leverage the **Composition API** rather than the traditional Options API. This method helps organize logic more effectively and enhances reactivity.

1. **Specify the Composition API**: When you request code, make it clear that you want examples using the Composition API.
   - For instance, you might say: `Can you provide a Vue.js example using the Composition API?`

2. **Request proper reactivity**: Make sure the code includes `ref` or `reactive` for managing state.
   - You could ask: `Please include reactivity with ref or reactive in the example.`

3. **Ask for composable functions**: Request that logic is wrapped in composable functions for easier reuse.
   - A good prompt would be: `Can you show how to create composable functions for shared logic?`

4. **Incorporate TypeScript**: If you use TypeScript, ask for it to be included for added type safety.
   - You might say: `Could you provide TypeScript support in the example?`

5. **Review and adapt**: Once you have the code, tweak it to suit your specific needs or project structure.

Expected outcome: You will get modern Vue.js code that’s modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

### HERE IS WHY IT WORKS
Using the Composition API organizes your code better, making it simpler to manage and reuse logic across different components. This becomes especially handy in larger applications, where keeping track of state and functionality can get tricky.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: Using Options API
  ```javascript
  export default {
    data() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    methods: {
      increment() {
        this.count++;
      }
    }
  };
  ```
- **After**: Using Composition API
  ```javascript
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  export default {
    setup() {
      const count = ref(0);
      const increment = () => count.value++;
      return { count, increment };
    }
  };
  ```

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not using `ref` or `reactive`**: Always manage state with these to ensure reactivity.
  - Fix: Change plain variables to `ref` or `reactive`.
  
- **Ignoring composable functions**: Don’t put all logic directly in components.
  - Fix: Create separate files for composable functions to keep components tidy.
  
- **Neglecting TypeScript types**: Forgetting to define types can lead to runtime issues.
  - Fix: Use TypeScript interfaces or types for props and state.
  
- **Overcomplicating the setup function**: Keep the `setup` function focused and straightforward.
  - Fix: Break down complex logic into smaller composable functions.
