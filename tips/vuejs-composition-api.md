To enhance code reusability and maintainability in Vue.js, request code examples that utilize the **Composition API** instead of the traditional Options API. This approach allows for better organization of logic and improved reactivity. 

1. **Specify the Composition API**: When asking for code, clearly state that you want examples using the Composition API.
   - Example prompt: `Can you provide a Vue.js example using the Composition API?`
   
2. **Request proper reactivity**: Ensure the code uses `ref` or `reactive` for state management.
   - Example prompt: `Please include reactivity with ref or reactive in the example.`

3. **Ask for composable functions**: Request that logic be encapsulated in composable functions for reuse.
   - Example prompt: `Can you show how to create composable functions for shared logic?`

4. **Incorporate TypeScript**: If applicable, ask for TypeScript integration to leverage type safety.
   - Example prompt: `Could you provide TypeScript support in the example?`

5. **Review and adapt**: After receiving the code, adapt it to fit your specific use case or project structure.

Expected result: You will receive modern Vue.js code that is modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

### WHY IT WORKS
Using the Composition API promotes better organization of code, making it easier to manage and reuse logic across components. This is particularly useful in larger applications where maintaining state and functionality can become complex.

### QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: Using Options API
  ```javascript
  export default {
    data() {
      return { count: 0 };
    },
    methods: {
      increment() {
        this.count++;
      }
    }
  };
  ```
- **After**: Using Composition API
  ```javascript
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  export default {
    setup() {
      const count = ref(0);
      const increment = () => count.value++;
      return { count, increment };
    }
  };
  ```

### COMMON MISTAKES
- **Not using `ref` or `reactive`**: Ensure you always manage state with these for reactivity.
  - Fix: Replace plain variables with `ref` or `reactive`.
  
- **Ignoring composable functions**: Avoid placing all logic in components directly.
  - Fix: Create separate files for composable functions to keep components clean.
  
- **Neglecting TypeScript types**: Failing to define types can lead to runtime errors.
  - Fix: Use TypeScript interfaces or types for props and state.
  
- **Overcomplicating the setup function**: Keep the `setup` function concise and focused.
  - Fix: Break down complex logic into smaller composable functions.
