To keep your Rust code memory safe, it’s all about understanding **ownership** and **borrowing** patterns. This strategy helps you avoid data races and dangling references, making your applications more reliable. Here’s how you can request safe Rust code:

1. **Define Ownership Requirements**: Be clear about the ownership rules for your variables.
   - For example, say, "Make sure that the variable `x` is owned by the function and not passed by reference."

2. **Request Borrowing Guidelines**: Ask for clear borrowing patterns to steer clear of mutable aliasing.
   - You might say, "Use immutable references for reading, and only use mutable references when absolutely necessary."

3. **Include Lifetime Annotations**: If your code uses complex references, be sure to ask for lifetime annotations.
   - A good example would be, "Please add lifetime annotations to ensure references do not outlive their data."

4. **Highlight Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Stress the importance of performance without compromising safety.
   - You could say, "Use iterators and other zero-cost abstractions whenever possible."

5. **Request a Memory Safety Review**: Finally, ask for a review of the code to confirm it meets Rust’s memory safety standards.
   - You might ask, "Can you check that there are no potential data races or dangling references?"

By following these steps, you can expect Rust code that aligns with ownership, borrowing, and memory safety principles.

### Why This Matters
This method uses Rust's unique ownership system to enforce memory safety at compile time, which helps reduce runtime errors. It’s especially useful when writing or reviewing Rust code, particularly in concurrent applications.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```rust
  fn example(x: &i32) {
      let y = x; // Potential dangling reference
  }
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```rust
  fn example(x: i32) {
      let y = x; // Proper ownership
  }
  ```

- **Before**: 
  ```rust
  fn read_data(data: &mut Vec<i32>) {
      let ref1 = &data[0]; // Mutable aliasing
  }
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```rust
  fn read_data(data: &Vec<i32>) {
      let ref1 = &data[0]; // Immutable borrow
  }
  ```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Mistake**: Not specifying ownership can lead to confusion.
  - **Solution**: Always clarify ownership in your requests.
  
- **Mistake**: Using mutable references without a clear reason.
  - **Solution**: Only use mutable references when necessary and explain why.

- **Mistake**: Forgetting lifetime annotations in complex cases.
  - **Solution**: Include lifetime requirements in your requests to avoid ambiguity.

- **Mistake**: Overlooking the performance aspects of abstractions.
  - **Solution**: Explicitly request zero-cost abstractions to ensure your code remains efficient.
