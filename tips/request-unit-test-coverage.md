To ensure your software quality is top-notch, always ask for unit tests along with your implementation code. This step helps confirm that your code is tested for edge cases, error conditions, and standard use cases. Letâ€™s break down how to do this effectively:

1. **Specify your requirements**: Make it clear that you expect unit tests to accompany the code.
   - For example, you might say, "Please provide unit tests with the implementation code."

2. **Define the coverage areas**: Identify the specific scenarios you want the tests to cover.
   - You could request, "Include tests for edge cases, error handling, and typical user flows."

3. **Choose your testing framework**: Indicate the framework that fits your tech stack.
   - An example would be, "Use Jest for JavaScript or pytest for Python."

4. **Request documentation**: Ask for comments or documentation within the tests to explain their purpose.
   - You might say, "Please add comments to clarify the intent of each test case."

5. **Review the tests**: Once you receive the code, check that the tests are comprehensive and run them to ensure everything works.
   - You can run the tests using: `npm test` for Jest or `pytest` for pytest.

By following these steps, you can expect a complete implementation paired with unit tests that validate functionality and edge cases.

### Why This Matters
Requesting unit tests guarantees your code is not just functional but also robust against unexpected inputs and situations. This practice is especially important in collaborative settings or when passing code to other developers.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: "Please send me the code."
- **After**: "Please send me the code along with Jest tests covering edge cases and error handling."

- **Before**: "I need this function."
- **After**: "I need this function with pytest tests for normal and edge cases."

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying frameworks**: Always state which testing framework to use.
  - Fix: Include the framework in your request, like "Use Jest for JavaScript."

- **Vague test coverage requests**: Be clear about which scenarios to test.
  - Fix: Specify cases, such as "Test for null inputs and boundary values."

- **Neglecting documentation**: Tests without explanations can be confusing.
  - Fix: Ask for comments in the test code for better understanding.

- **Skipping test execution**: Not running tests can lead to unnoticed problems.
  - Fix: Always execute the tests using the right command after receiving the code.
