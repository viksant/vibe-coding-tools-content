To ensure robust software quality, always **request unit tests** alongside your implementation code. This guarantees that your code is thoroughly tested for edge cases, error conditions, and standard use cases. Hereâ€™s how to do it effectively:

1. **Specify your requirements**: Clearly state that you want unit tests included with the code.
   - Example request: "Please provide unit tests with the implementation code."
   
2. **Define the coverage areas**: Mention the specific scenarios you want the tests to cover.
   - Example: "Include tests for edge cases, error handling, and typical user flows."

3. **Choose your testing framework**: Specify the framework that aligns with your tech stack.
   - Example: "Use Jest for JavaScript or pytest for Python."

4. **Request documentation**: Ask for comments or documentation within the tests to explain their purpose.
   - Example: "Please add comments to clarify the intent of each test case."

5. **Review the tests**: After receiving the code, ensure that the tests are comprehensive and run them to verify functionality.
   - Command to run tests: `npm test` (for Jest) or `pytest` (for pytest).

Expected result: You will receive a complete implementation with corresponding unit tests that validate functionality and edge cases.

### Why It Works
Requesting unit tests ensures that your code is not only functional but also resilient against unexpected inputs and conditions. This practice is essential when working in collaborative environments or when handing off code to other developers.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: "Please send me the code."
- **After**: "Please send me the code along with Jest tests covering edge cases and error handling."

- **Before**: "I need this function."
- **After**: "I need this function with pytest tests for normal and edge cases."

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying frameworks**: Always mention which testing framework to use.
  - Fix: Include the framework in your request, e.g., "Use Jest for JavaScript."
  
- **Vague test coverage requests**: Be specific about what scenarios to test.
  - Fix: List out specific cases, e.g., "Test for null inputs and boundary values."

- **Neglecting documentation**: Tests without explanations can be hard to understand.
  - Fix: Request comments in the test code for clarity.

- **Skipping test execution**: Failing to run tests can lead to unnoticed issues.
  - Fix: Always run the tests using the appropriate command after receiving the code.
