To get clean and maintainable Python code, always ask for type hints and PEP 8 standards. This approach makes the code easier to read and helps catch errors early on.

1. **Specify your requirements** when you request code. Make sure to include type hints and PEP 8 compliance.
   - For example, say: "Please provide a Python function with type hints and PEP 8 compliance."
   
2. **Mention Pythonic patterns** that you want in the code, like list comprehensions or context managers.
   - You could say: "Use list comprehensions for creating lists."

3. **Request proper exception handling** to make the code more reliable.
   - For example: "Include exception handling for potential errors."

4. **Review the code** you receive to ensure it aligns with your specifications.
   - Look for type hints, PEP 8 formatting, and Pythonic structures.

5. **Test the code** to confirm it works as expected and can handle edge cases.
   - Run the code in your Python environment.

If you follow these steps, you’ll receive professional and maintainable Python code that follows best practices.

### Why It Works
Requesting type hints and PEP 8 compliance leads to clearer code that’s easier to understand and maintain. This method is helpful when collaborating with others or when you need code for long-term use.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
  ```
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  def read_file(filename):
      with open(filename) as f:
          return f.read()
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  def read_file(filename: str) -> str:
      with open(filename, 'r') as f:
          return f.read()
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying type hints**: Always include this in your request to avoid confusion.
- **Ignoring PEP 8 standards**: Remind the coder to format the code according to PEP 8.
- **Overlooking exception handling**: Stress the importance of robust error handling in your request.
- **Not testing the code**: Always run the code to ensure it meets your requirements and can handle edge cases.
