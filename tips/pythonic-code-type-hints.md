To ensure you receive clean, maintainable Python code, always request type hints and adherence to PEP 8 standards. This practice enhances code readability and helps catch errors early. 

1. **Specify your requirements** when asking for code. Include the need for type hints and PEP 8 compliance.
   - Example request: "Please provide a Python function with type hints and PEP 8 compliance."
2. **Mention Pythonic patterns** you want in the code, such as list comprehensions or context managers.
   - Example: "Use list comprehensions for creating lists."
3. **Request proper exception handling** to ensure robustness.
   - Example: "Include exception handling for potential errors."
4. **Review the code** you receive to ensure it meets your specifications.
   - Check for type hints, PEP 8 formatting, and Pythonic structures.
5. **Test the code** to confirm it runs as expected and handles edge cases.
   - Run the code in your Python environment.

Expected result: You will receive professional and maintainable Python code that adheres to best practices.

### Why It Works
Requesting type hints and PEP 8 compliance leads to clearer code that is easier to understand and maintain. Use this approach when collaborating with others or when you need code that will be used long-term.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b
  ```
- **Before**: 
  ```python
  def read_file(filename):
      with open(filename) as f:
          return f.read()
  ```
- **After**: 
  ```python
  def read_file(filename: str) -> str:
      with open(filename, 'r') as f:
          return f.read()
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Not specifying type hints**: Always include this in your request to avoid ambiguity.
- **Ignoring PEP 8 standards**: Remind the coder to format the code according to PEP 8.
- **Overlooking exception handling**: Emphasize the need for robust error handling in your request.
- **Not testing the code**: Always run the code to ensure it meets your requirements and handles edge cases.
