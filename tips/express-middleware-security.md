To make your Express.js applications more secure, you should set up some key middleware configurations. This step helps protect your app from common vulnerabilities and attacks. Let's walk through the steps to set up your security middleware effectively.

1. **Install the necessary packages**: You can easily do this with npm. Just run the following command to install `helmet`, `express-rate-limit`, and `cors`.
   ```bash
   npm install helmet express-rate-limit cors
   ```
   After running this command, you'll see these packages installed in your project.

2. **Require the middleware in your app**: Open your main server file, such as `app.js`, and add these lines.
   ```javascript
   const helmet = require('helmet');
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const cors = require('cors');
   ```
   Once you've added these, the middleware will be imported and ready for use.

3. **Use Helmet for security headers**: To apply security headers, simply add this line to your middleware setup.
   ```javascript
   app.use(helmet());
   ```
   With this in place, security headers will apply to all your responses.

4. **Set up rate limiting**: You’ll want to define a rate limit and apply it to your routes. Here's how you can do that:
   ```javascript
   const limiter = rateLimit({
       windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
       max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
   });
   app.use(limiter);
   ```
   This setup ensures that rate limiting is enforced on your application.

5. **Enable CORS**: To allow cross-origin requests, add this line.
   ```javascript
   app.use(cors());
   ```
   Now, CORS is configured, which enables specified origins to make requests.

### Why It Works
This combination provides a solid defense against common web vulnerabilities. It's especially useful when you're building APIs or web applications that require user authentication and data protection.

### Quick Examples
Let’s look at some quick comparisons:

- **Before**: You don’t have any security middleware in place.
- **After**: You’ve implemented Helmet, rate limiting, and CORS.
  ```javascript
  // Before
  app.use(express.json());
  
  // After
  app.use(helmet());
  app.use(limiter);
  app.use(cors());
  ```

- **Before**: You might not have input validation.
- **After**: You can use a validation library like `express-validator`.
  First, install it:
  ```bash
  npm install express-validator
  ```
  Then, set it up in your routes:
  ```javascript
  const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');
  app.post('/user', 
      body('email').isEmail(),
      (req, res) => {
          const errors = validationResult(req);
          if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
              return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
          }
          // Proceed with user creation
      });
  ```

### Common Mistakes
Watch out for these common pitfalls:
- **Not using Helmet**: Always include Helmet to set those crucial security headers.
- **Ignoring rate limits**: If you skip rate limiting, your app can get abused. Always set sensible limits.
- **Misconfiguring CORS**: Make sure CORS is set to allow only trusted origins to keep security risks at bay.
- **Skipping input validation**: Always validate user input to avoid injection attacks. Libraries like `express-validator` can help with this.
