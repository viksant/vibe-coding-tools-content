To request code snippets for Next.js 13+ using App Router patterns effectively, be clear about your needs. This clarity helps you get modern and structured examples that utilize server components, route handlers, and layout patterns well.

1. **Define your requirements**: Start by stating exactly what you need, like server components or route handlers.
   - For instance, you might say, "Show me a server component for fetching user data."

2. **Specify the App Router structure**: Make sure to mention that you want the code to follow the App directory conventions.
   - An example request could be, "Use the App Router conventions in the code."

3. **Request TypeScript support**: Indicate your preference for TypeScript to ensure type safety.
   - You can say, "Please provide the code in TypeScript."

4. **Ask for examples**: Request clear examples to understand how the code fits together.
   - Try asking, "Can you provide a complete example of a layout with nested routes?"

5. **Review and test the code**: Once you receive the code, implement it in your project to check if it works as expected.
   - For example, copy the provided code into your Next.js project and run it.

When you follow these steps, you’ll get tailored, modern Next.js code snippets that match your project structure and needs.

### Why It Works
This approach guarantees you receive relevant, up-to-date code that meets Next.js 13+ standards. Use this method when starting new projects or migrating existing ones to take full advantage of the latest features available.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: "Show me a Next.js component."
- **After**: "Show me a TypeScript server component using App Router for fetching user data."
- **Code**: 
  ```typescript
  // app/users/page.tsx
  import { User } from '@/types';

  const UsersPage = async () => {
    const users: User[] = await fetch('/api/users').then(res => res.json());
    return (
      <div>
        {users.map(user => <div key={user.id}>{user.name}</div>)}
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default UsersPage;
  ```

- **Before**: "How do I create a layout?"
- **After**: "Provide a layout component with nested routes in Next.js 13+."
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  // app/layout.tsx
  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <html>
        <body>
          <header>My App Header</header>
          {children}
          <footer>My App Footer</footer>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Vague requests**: Avoid asking for generic Next.js code; be specific about using App Router patterns.
  - **Fix**: Always include "App Router" in your request.

- **Ignoring TypeScript**: Not specifying TypeScript could lead to receiving JavaScript code.
  - **Fix**: Clearly state you want TypeScript in your request.

- **Not testing the code**: Don’t assume the provided code works without testing it.
  - **Fix**: Always implement and test the code in your environment.

- **Overlooking version compatibility**: Using outdated patterns from earlier Next.js versions might cause issues.
  - **Fix**: Specify that you need code for Next.js 13+ to ensure compatibility.
