To efficiently request code snippets for Next.js 13+ using App Router patterns, specify your needs clearly to ensure you receive modern, structured examples. This approach helps you leverage server components, route handlers, and layout patterns effectively.

1. **Define your requirements**: Clearly state what you need, such as server components or route handlers.
   - Example: "Show me a server component for fetching user data."
   
2. **Specify the App Router structure**: Mention that you want the code to follow the App directory conventions.
   - Example: "Use the App Router conventions in the code."

3. **Request TypeScript support**: Indicate that you want the code in TypeScript for type safety.
   - Example: "Please provide the code in TypeScript."

4. **Ask for examples**: Request concrete examples to see how the code fits together.
   - Example: "Can you provide a complete example of a layout with nested routes?"

5. **Review and test the code**: After receiving the code, implement it in your project to ensure it works as expected.
   - Example: Copy the provided code into your Next.js project and run it.

Expected result: You will receive tailored, modern Next.js code snippets that align with your project structure and requirements.

### Why It Works
This method ensures you get relevant, up-to-date code that adheres to Next.js 13+ standards. Use this approach when starting new projects or migrating existing ones to take full advantage of the latest features.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: "Show me a Next.js component."
- **After**: "Show me a TypeScript server component using App Router for fetching user data."
- **Code**: 
  ```typescript
  // app/users/page.tsx
  import { User } from '@/types';

  const UsersPage = async () => {
    const users: User[] = await fetch('/api/users').then(res => res.json());
    return (
      <div>
        {users.map(user => <div key={user.id}>{user.name}</div>)}
      </div>
    );
  };

  export default UsersPage;
  ```

- **Before**: "How do I create a layout?"
- **After**: "Provide a layout component with nested routes in Next.js 13+."
- **Code**:
  ```typescript
  // app/layout.tsx
  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <html>
        <body>
          <header>My App Header</header>
          {children}
          <footer>My App Footer</footer>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

### Common Mistakes
- **Vague requests**: Avoid asking for general Next.js code; be specific about App Router patterns.
  - **Fix**: Always include "App Router" in your request.
  
- **Ignoring TypeScript**: Not specifying TypeScript may result in JavaScript code.
  - **Fix**: Explicitly state you want TypeScript in your request.

- **Not testing the code**: Assuming the provided code works without testing.
  - **Fix**: Always implement and test the code in your environment.

- **Overlooking version compatibility**: Using outdated patterns from earlier Next.js versions.
  - **Fix**: Specify that you need code for Next.js 13+ to ensure compatibility.
