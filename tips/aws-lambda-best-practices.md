To optimize AWS Lambda functions for performance and cost, request specific best practices when generating your code. This ensures your serverless functions run efficiently and economically.

1. **Specify cold start optimization**: Ask for techniques to minimize latency during the initial invocation.
   - Example request: `Optimize for cold start by using lighter libraries and keeping the function warm.`
   
2. **Define memory allocation**: Inquire about the best memory settings for your function's workload.
   - Example request: `Allocate memory based on performance testing results to balance speed and cost.`
   
3. **Request efficient packaging**: Ensure the code is packaged with only necessary dependencies.
   - Example request: `Package the function with only essential libraries to reduce deployment size.`
   
4. **Utilize environment variables**: Ask for strategies to manage configuration and secrets securely.
   - Example request: `Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding sensitive data.`
   
5. **Seek cost optimization strategies**: Request tips on reducing execution costs.
   - Example request: `Implement provisioned concurrency for predictable workloads to manage costs effectively.`

Expected result: Your AWS Lambda functions will be optimized for faster execution and lower costs.

### Why It Works
These practices enhance performance by reducing latency and resource consumption, leading to lower costs. Use this approach when designing new serverless applications or optimizing existing functions.

### Quick Examples
- **Before**: Slow cold starts due to heavy libraries.
  - **After**: `Optimize for cold start by using lighter libraries and keeping the function warm.`
  
- **Before**: Hardcoded configuration values.
  - **After**: `Use environment variables for configuration to avoid hardcoding sensitive data.`

- **Before**: High execution costs due to inefficient memory allocation.
  - **After**: `Allocate memory based on performance testing results to balance speed and cost.`

### Common Mistakes
- **Ignoring cold start issues**: Always consider cold start optimizations for latency-sensitive applications. 
- **Over-allocating memory**: Test different memory settings to find the optimal balance. 
- **Including unnecessary dependencies**: Audit your packages to ensure only essential libraries are included.
- **Hardcoding sensitive information**: Always use environment variables for sensitive data to enhance security.
