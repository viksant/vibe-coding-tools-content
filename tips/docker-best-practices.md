To optimize your Dockerfiles and container configurations, request specific best practices that enhance performance and security. This will help you create efficient images and streamline your development process.

1. **Specify multi-stage builds** to reduce image size:
   - Request: `Use multi-stage builds to separate build dependencies from runtime dependencies.`
   
2. **Choose minimal base images** for faster builds:
   - Request: `Select lightweight base images like Alpine or Distroless.`
   
3. **Implement proper layer caching** to speed up builds:
   - Request: `Organize Dockerfile commands to maximize cache usage, placing less frequently changed commands at the top.`
   
4. **Include security scanning** for vulnerabilities:
   - Request: `Integrate tools like Trivy or Clair in your CI/CD pipeline to scan images for vulnerabilities.`
   
5. **Differentiate development vs production configurations**:
   - Request: `Create separate Dockerfiles or use build arguments to customize configurations for development and production environments.`

Expected result: You will have optimized Dockerfiles that improve build times, reduce image sizes, and enhance security.

## WHY IT WORKS
These practices ensure that your Docker images are lightweight, secure, and efficient. Use them when setting up new projects or optimizing existing ones to enhance your development workflow.

## QUICK EXAMPLES
- **Before**: 
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu:latest
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y build-essential
  ```
  **After**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM golang:alpine AS builder
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN go build -o myapp
  ```

- **Before**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:14
  RUN npm install
  ```
  **After**:
  ```dockerfile
  FROM node:14-alpine
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY package*.json ./
  RUN npm install --production
  ```

## COMMON MISTAKES
- **Using large base images**: Always opt for minimal base images like Alpine.
- **Neglecting layer caching**: Structure your Dockerfile to keep frequently changing commands at the bottom.
- **Skipping security scans**: Always integrate a security scanning tool in your CI/CD pipeline.
- **Not separating dev and prod configurations**: Use different Dockerfiles or build arguments to manage configurations effectively.
