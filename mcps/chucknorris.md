# ChuckNorris

ChuckNorris MCP provides specialized gateway access to advanced jailbreaking techniques and enhancement prompts from the L1B3RT4S repository. This tool enables security researchers and developers to test AI model boundaries by dynamically adapting prompts to different LLM architectures, allowing for comprehensive evaluation of AI limitations and response capabilities. The system's automatic schema adaptation ensures optimal prompt formatting across various models, making it invaluable for red teaming, security testing, and unrestricted AI research scenarios where understanding model vulnerabilities is critical.
