# Robinhood MCP Server

The Robinhood MCP Server provides developers with a complete interface to interact programmatically with Robinhood's cryptocurrency trading platform. It handles all aspects of the Robinhood Crypto API including secure authentication, account management, real-time market data streaming, and trading operations. The server supports both REST API for standard requests and WebSocket interfaces for live data feeds, enabling developers to build automated trading bots, portfolio management tools, and market analysis applications.

This MCP server simplifies the complexity of direct API integration by providing standardized tools for authentication flow management, rate limiting, and error handling. Developers can focus on building their trading strategies and applications rather than dealing with low-level API complexities. Use cases include algorithmic trading systems, portfolio rebalancing tools, price alert services, and custom trading dashboards that require real-time market data and execution capabilities.
