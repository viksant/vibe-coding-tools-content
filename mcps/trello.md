# Trello

This MCP provides a natural language interface to the Trello API, enabling developers to manage their project boards, lists, and cards through conversational commands. It abstracts away the complexity of API endpoints and authentication, allowing users to create cards, move items between lists, assign members, set due dates, and organize workflows using simple English instructions.

The integration streamlines project management by automating routine Trello operations and enabling seamless workflow optimization. Developers can use this MCP to build intelligent project tracking systems, automate team coordination tasks, and create custom project management solutions that integrate Trello with other development tools and platforms.
