# Dojo

This MCP server provides a seamless integration with the Dojo framework, enabling developers to build and manage real-time, interactive applications through customizable tools and prompts. It leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) to facilitate live data streaming and bidirectional communication, allowing for dynamic updates and responsive user interfaces without the complexity of WebSockets. Developers can create tailored development environments that support collaborative coding, live debugging, and instant feedback loops.

The integration empowers teams to streamline their workflow by offering real-time insights into application state, performance metrics, and user interactions. Use cases include building interactive dashboards, multiplayer gaming platforms, and collaborative editing tools where immediate data synchronization is critical. By abstracting the underlying SSE mechanics, this MCP reduces boilerplate code and accelerates development, making it ideal for projects requiring high interactivity and low-latency communication.
