# Tesla Fleet API

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Tesla Fleet API, allowing developers to programmatically monitor and control Tesla vehicles through secure OAuth 2.0 authentication. It enables comprehensive vehicle management capabilities including wake-up commands, status information retrieval, and real-time data refreshing for telemetry and operational metrics.

Developers can build applications for fleet management, vehicle tracking, remote diagnostics, and automated control systems. The MCP handles authentication flows and API interactions, making it ideal for creating dashboards, IoT integrations, and enterprise fleet solutions that require reliable access to Tesla vehicle data and commands.
