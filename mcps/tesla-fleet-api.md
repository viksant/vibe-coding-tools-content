This MCP connects smoothly with the Tesla Fleet API, giving developers the tools they need to monitor and control Tesla vehicles using secure OAuth 2.0 authentication. 

It opens the door to a wide range of vehicle management features. For instance, developers can send wake-up commands, gather status information, and refresh real-time data for telemetry and operational metrics.

With this MCP, developers can create applications focused on fleet management, vehicle tracking, remote diagnostics, and automated control systems. 

It takes care of the authentication processes and API interactions, making it perfect for building dashboards, IoT integrations, and enterprise fleet solutions that need consistent access to Tesla vehicle data and commands.
