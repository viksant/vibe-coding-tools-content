# Deep Research

Deep Research MCP orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to conduct comprehensive investigations on complex subjects. Each agent focuses on different aspects of research—data gathering, analysis, synthesis, and validation—working collaboratively to produce thorough, well-rounded results. The system provides real-time progress reporting, allowing developers to monitor each stage of the research process and intervene when necessary.

This MCP enables highly customizable research outputs with adjustable tones ranging from academic to conversational, making it suitable for diverse applications like technical documentation, market analysis, or scientific literature reviews. Built-in error handling ensures research continuity by automatically rerouting failed tasks to alternative agents and providing detailed failure analysis. Developers can integrate this capability into applications requiring deep domain expertise without maintaining multiple AI models internally.
