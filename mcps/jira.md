The JIRA MCP connects language models with JIRA's project management platform. This link lets LLMs pull in detailed issue descriptions, custom field data, comments, and project metadata straight from JIRA.

Developers can tap into this connection to create smart project assistants, streamline issue analysis, and produce insights based on live project data.

With this MCP, teams can enjoy features like automated issue summarization, smart project reporting, and AI-driven project management help. They can take advantage of LLM analysis to understand complex project dependencies, automate status updates, and categorize issues intelligently using custom field data.

This integration works with both cloud and self-hosted JIRA instances, offering flexibility for organizations with different setup preferences while ensuring secure authentication protocols.
