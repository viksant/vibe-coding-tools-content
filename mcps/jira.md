# JIRA

The JIRA MCP provides a seamless integration between language models and JIRA's comprehensive project management platform. This connection allows LLMs to retrieve detailed issue descriptions, custom field data, comments, and project metadata directly from JIRA instances. Developers can leverage this integration to build intelligent project assistants, automate issue analysis, and generate contextual insights based on real-time project data.

This MCP enables use cases such as automated issue summarization, intelligent project reporting, and AI-powered project management assistance. Teams can benefit from LLM-driven analysis of complex project dependencies, automated status updates, and intelligent categorization of issues based on custom field data. The integration supports both cloud and self-hosted JIRA instances, providing flexibility for organizations with different deployment preferences while maintaining secure authentication protocols.
