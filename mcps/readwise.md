The Readwise MCP connects directly to your Readwise knowledge base, giving you quick access to saved articles, book highlights, documents, and annotations. 

Why does this matter? It lets you search, reference, and analyze your personal insights during conversations with AI. You can turn your knowledge into an interactive resource that works for you.

For developers, this integration opens up new possibilities. You can create AI assistants that pull from specific technical documentation, research papers, or learning materials stored in Readwise. 

Think about it: you can build coding assistants that remember key points from API documentation, research tools that link saved articles, or learning companions that fetch notes from books related to technical concepts. 

In short, the MCP changes your Readwise library into a lively knowledge graph, making your AI interactions more personalized and relevant.
