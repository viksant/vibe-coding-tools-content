# Readwise

The Readwise MCP enables seamless integration with your Readwise knowledge base, providing direct access to saved articles, book highlights, documents, and annotations. This allows you to search, reference, and analyze your personal collection of insights during AI-powered conversations, turning your accumulated knowledge into an interactive resource.

Developers can leverage this integration to build AI assistants that reference specific technical documentation, research papers, or learning materials stored in Readwise. Use cases include creating coding assistants that recall API documentation highlights, research tools that cross-reference saved articles, or learning companions that retrieve book notes for technical concepts. The MCP transforms your Readwise library into a dynamic knowledge graph that enhances AI interactions with personalized context.
