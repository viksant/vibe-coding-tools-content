The "Programmer's Guide to Cooking at Home" repository has inspired this MCP server, which offers smart recipe recommendations and meal planning help.

If you've ever found yourself wondering, "What should I eat today?" this server has your back. It provides tailored cooking suggestions based on what ingredients you have, your dietary preferences, and your cooking skills.

This server is a great resource for developers working on cooking assistants, meal planning apps, or smart kitchen systems. It gives them access to a rich recipe database filled with easy-to-follow cooking instructions.
