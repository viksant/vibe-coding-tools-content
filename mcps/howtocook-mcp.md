# Howtocook Mcp

Based on the popular 'Programmer's Guide to Cooking at Home' repository, this MCP server provides intelligent recipe recommendations and meal planning assistance. It helps solve the common dilemma of 'what to eat today' by offering curated cooking suggestions based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking skill level. The server is particularly useful for developers building cooking assistants, meal planning applications, or smart kitchen systems that require access to a comprehensive recipe database with programmer-friendly cooking instructions.
