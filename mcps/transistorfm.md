# Transistor.fm

This MCP provides a comprehensive interface to Transistor.fm's podcast hosting API, enabling developers to programmatically manage their entire podcast ecosystem. You can create and update podcasts, publish new episodes, retrieve detailed analytics, and manage subscriber lists through code. This automation capability streamlines podcast production workflows, allowing for integration with content management systems, automated publishing pipelines, and custom analytics dashboards.

The integration supports bulk operations for handling multiple podcasts or episodes simultaneously, making it ideal for podcast networks or content creators with frequent publishing schedules. Developers can build custom tools for episode scheduling, subscriber management, performance tracking, and cross-platform content distribution. This eliminates manual repetitive tasks and enables data-driven decisions about content strategy based on real-time analytics.
