This MCP offers a user-friendly interface to Transistor.fm's podcast hosting API, giving developers the tools they need to manage their podcast ecosystem through code.

You can create and update podcasts, publish new episodes, fetch detailed analytics, and handle subscriber listsâ€”all programmatically. This ability to automate tasks makes podcast production smoother. It allows you to connect with content management systems, set up automated publishing pipelines, and create custom analytics dashboards.

The integration even supports bulk operations, so you can manage multiple podcasts or episodes at once. This feature is perfect for podcast networks or creators who publish frequently.

With this setup, developers can create tailored tools for scheduling episodes, managing subscribers, tracking performance, and distributing content across platforms. By doing this, you can ditch repetitive manual tasks and make informed decisions about your content strategy using real-time analytics.
