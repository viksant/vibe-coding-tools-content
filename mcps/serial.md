# Serial

The Serial MCP server provides a bridge between software applications and physical hardware devices through serial communication protocols. This enables developers to send commands, receive sensor data, and control connected devices in real-time, making it ideal for IoT deployments, robotics projects, and embedded systems development.

By abstracting the complexities of serial communication, this MCP allows developers to focus on application logic rather than low-level hardware interactions. It supports various baud rates, data formats, and flow control settings, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. Use cases include remote monitoring systems, automated control applications, and prototyping environments where direct hardware interaction is required.
