# Linear

The Linear MCP provides developers with powerful AI-driven automation capabilities for project management workflows. By integrating directly with Linear's API, this MCP enables automated issue creation, status tracking, and project coordination without manual intervention. Developers can streamline their development processes by having AI assistants create, update, and monitor issues based on code changes, discussions, or predefined triggers.

This integration supports complex project management scenarios including sprint planning, bug tracking, and feature development workflows. Teams can maintain better visibility into project progress while reducing administrative overhead. The MCP facilitates intelligent task assignment, priority management, and real-time project updates, making it ideal for agile development teams seeking to optimize their project tracking and collaboration efficiency through AI-powered automation.
