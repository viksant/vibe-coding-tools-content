# SoundCloud Downloader

This MCP provides a robust interface for programmatically downloading audio content from SoundCloud, offering developers granular control over the entire download process. It supports downloading individual tracks, full playlists, and user uploads with configurable output directories, file naming conventions, and metadata preservation including track titles, artist information, and cover art.

Developers can implement advanced download strategies through features like concurrent download limits, resumable downloads, and quality selection. This enables building applications for content archiving, offline music players, research data collection, or automated backup systems while respecting SoundCloud's terms of service through controlled rate limiting and ethical usage patterns.
