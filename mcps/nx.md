The Nx MCP server works hand in hand with Nx monorepos, allowing LLMs to see everything about your projects. It understands how your projects relate to each other, tracks task dependencies, and knows how files connect and fit into your overall architecture.

This clarity helps AI assistants create code tailored to your tech stack. They can navigate cross-project dependencies and make changes across multiple files smoothly.

The server relies on Nx's project graph and workspace configuration. This setup ensures it provides the right context for generating code, refactoring, and assessing potential impacts. It's a key tool for keeping things consistent in complex monorepo setups.
