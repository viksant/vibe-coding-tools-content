# Nx

The Nx MCP server provides deep integration with Nx monorepos, giving LLMs complete visibility into project relationships, task dependencies, file mappings, and architectural patterns. This enables AI assistants to generate code that respects your specific tech stack, understand cross-project dependencies, and make coordinated changes across multiple files. The server leverages Nx's built-in project graph and workspace configuration to provide accurate context for code generation, refactoring, and impact analysis, making it essential for maintaining consistency in complex monorepo environments.
