# aws-pricing-mcp

The AWS EC2 Pricing MCP Server provides developers with programmatic access to real-time AWS EC2 pricing data through a simple API call. It leverages a pre-parsed AWS pricing catalog to answer complex queries about instance specifications, pricing models, and regional variations without requiring manual navigation of AWS's complex pricing pages.

This tool enables cost optimization by allowing developers to find the most cost-effective instances based on specific requirements like RAM, CPU specifications, operating systems, or reserved instance discounts. Use cases include infrastructure planning, budget forecasting, automated cost analysis in CI/CD pipelines, and building internal cost optimization tools that need real-time pricing data.
