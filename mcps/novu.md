This MCP works hand in hand with Novu's strong notification infrastructure. It lets developers manage subscribers, trigger notifications, and send messages through various channels right from their applications.

It simplifies notification systems by offering straightforward API calls for everyday tasks like adding subscribers, sending transactional emails, push notifications, and SMS messages.

With this integration, you can tap into Novu's multi-channel delivery options, including email, SMS, push notifications, in-app messages, and chat platforms.

Developers can use this MCP to create solid notification systems that grow alongside their applications. This setup ensures reliable message delivery while keeping business logic separate from the notification infrastructure.

This approach is especially useful for SaaS applications, e-commerce platforms, and any system that needs to engage users with timely and targeted communications.
