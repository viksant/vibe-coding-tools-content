# mcp-server-flomo MCP Server

The mcp-server-flomo MCP enables developers to seamlessly capture and organize their technical notes, code snippets, and development ideas directly within their workflow. By integrating with Flomo's minimalist note-taking platform, developers can quickly record thoughts without context switching, ensuring valuable insights and learnings are preserved for future reference. This MCP is particularly useful for documenting debugging processes, architectural decisions, and daily standup notes that can be easily searched and referenced later.

The integration supports automatic tagging, search functionality, and organization of technical content, making it ideal for individual developers and teams who want to maintain a structured knowledge base. With support for markdown formatting and API-driven note creation, it streamlines the process of capturing technical documentation while maintaining focus on coding tasks.
