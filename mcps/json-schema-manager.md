# JSON Schema Manager

The JSON Schema Manager MCP provides tools for creating, validating, and managing JSON schemas to ensure data consistency across applications. It enables developers to define structured data templates with specific property requirements, data types, and validation rules, reducing errors and maintaining integrity throughout the development lifecycle.

This MCP supports generating JSON document instances from schemas with customizable properties, allowing for rapid prototyping and template-based document creation. Developers can use it to automate data validation, enforce business rules, and create standardized data formats for APIs, configuration files, and database schemas, streamlining development workflows and improving data quality.
