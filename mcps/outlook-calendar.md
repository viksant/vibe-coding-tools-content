# Outlook Calendar

This MCP provides seamless integration with Microsoft Outlook Calendar, enabling developers to build applications that automate calendar management and scheduling workflows. It offers comprehensive APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting calendar events, managing attendee lists, checking availability, and handling meeting invitations. This allows for sophisticated scheduling automation, conflict resolution, and real-time calendar synchronization across distributed systems.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build productivity tools that streamline meeting coordination, automate resource booking, and provide intelligent scheduling assistance. Use cases include automated meeting schedulers that find optimal times across multiple calendars, resource management systems that book conference rooms and equipment, and productivity dashboards that aggregate calendar data with other business systems. The integration supports both personal and organizational calendar management, making it ideal for building enterprise productivity applications and team collaboration tools.
