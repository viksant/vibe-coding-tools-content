# BaseScan

BaseScan MCP serves as a specialized interface for AI agents to access and query data from the Base Network blockchain. This MCP provides real-time access to blockchain transactions, smart contract data, and network analytics, enabling intelligent agents to perform on-chain analysis and make data-driven decisions. It simplifies blockchain data retrieval by abstracting complex RPC calls and providing structured responses that AI systems can easily process and utilize.

Developers can build sophisticated AI applications that monitor blockchain activity, analyze transaction patterns, and interact with smart contracts programmatically. The MCP handles authentication, rate limiting, and data formatting, allowing AI agents to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure concerns. This is particularly valuable for DeFi applications, NFT analytics, and blockchain monitoring systems that require real-time on-chain intelligence.
