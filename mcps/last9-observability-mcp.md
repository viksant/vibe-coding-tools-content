The Last9 Observability MCP makes it easy for developers to connect production monitoring with local development. It streams live logs, metrics, and traces straight into your coding environment. 

This setup allows developers to see how their code performs in production without needing to switch contexts or deal with delayed reports. With immediate access to real-time telemetry data, they can quickly spot performance issues, errors, and anomalies as they arise.

Thanks to this integration, developers can use insights from production to fix issues on the fly, test solutions with real-world data, and validate changes before rolling them out. 

The MCP supports proactive debugging, helps reduce the time it takes to resolve issues, and enhances code quality by basing local development on actual production behavior.

This tool is especially helpful for distributed systems, microservices architectures, and applications that need to be highly reliable.
