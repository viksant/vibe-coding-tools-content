This MCP offers a straightforward RESTful API for managing VMware ESXi and vCenter environments. It allows developers to control their virtual infrastructure using standard HTTP endpoints.

Thanks to its integration with pyVmomi, VMware's official Python SDK, users gain full access to VMware's management features while keeping the complexity hidden behind a clean, user-friendly API.

With this MCP, developers can automate various VM lifecycle operations. This includes creating, configuring, starting, shutting down, and deleting virtual machines. They can also access real-time performance metrics and monitor system health.

These capabilities open the door for creating custom management dashboards, automated provisioning workflows, and integrating with DevOps pipelines for infrastructure as code.

The MCP proves especially useful for cloud operations teams, DevOps engineers, and platform developers who want to weave VMware virtualization management into their applications and automation systems.
