This MCP works smoothly with Together AI's Flux.1 Schnell model, which helps developers create high-quality images using a reliable API. 

You can customize image dimensions, giving you control over resolution and aspect ratios to fit your application's needs. Plus, the built-in error handling helps keep things running smoothly by managing API limitations, rate limits, and generation failures, all while providing clear feedback.

Developers can use this MCP for a variety of purposes, such as content creation, prototyping, and applications that rely on dynamic image generation. 

It also features an optional image-saving option that lets you store generated assets locally. This is handy for both real-time applications and batch processing workflows. Overall, this integration makes working with advanced AI image generation easier while ensuring flexibility and reliability in different development scenarios.
