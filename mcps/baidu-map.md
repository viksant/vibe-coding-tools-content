Baidu Map's MCP server delivers a wide range of mapping and location services that work seamlessly with the Model Context Protocol. 

As the first map provider in China to support MCP, Baidu gives users access to a wealth of mapping data, geocoding, routing, and local business information. 

This means that AI applications can easily integrate precise Chinese location data, navigation, and geographic insights into their operations.
