# Morpho

This MCP provides seamless integration with Morpho's GraphQL API, enabling developers to access comprehensive DeFi protocol data for portfolio management and yield optimization. It allows querying real-time market information, vault details, user positions, and historical APY data to build sophisticated DeFi applications and analytics tools.

Developers can leverage this integration to create automated yield farming strategies, portfolio tracking dashboards, and risk management systems. The GraphQL interface provides flexible querying capabilities, making it ideal for building applications that require real-time DeFi data analysis and decision-making support for optimal yield generation across Morpho's lending markets.
