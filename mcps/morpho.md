This MCP connects smoothly with Morpho's GraphQL API, giving developers a way to tap into a wealth of DeFi protocol data thatâ€™s perfect for managing portfolios and boosting yields.

With this integration, you can pull in real-time market data, vault specifics, user positions, and historical APY figures. This information helps you build advanced DeFi applications and analytics tools.

Developers can use this connection to set up automated yield farming strategies, create portfolio tracking dashboards, and develop risk management systems.

The GraphQL interface offers flexible querying options, making it a great fit for applications that need real-time analysis of DeFi data. This support helps users make decisions that lead to better yield generation across Morpho's lending markets.
