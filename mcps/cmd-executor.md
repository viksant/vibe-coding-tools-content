# CMD Executor

The CMD Executor MCP server provides a standardized interface for executing command-line operations across Windows and Linux environments. It enables developers to run shell commands, scripts, and system utilities programmatically through a consistent API, eliminating platform-specific complexities. This server supports both local command execution and remote operations via SSH connections, making it ideal for automation workflows, system administration tasks, and cross-platform deployment scripts.

Developers benefit from simplified system interactions for tasks like file management, process control, package installation, and environment configuration. The MCP handles command execution, output capture, error handling, and connection management, allowing teams to build reliable automation tools that work consistently across different operating systems. Use cases include CI/CD pipeline automation, infrastructure management, remote server administration, and development environment setup scripts.
