# gotoHuman

gotoHuman MCP enables developers to integrate human-in-the-loop workflows into their AI-powered applications and automations. This allows for critical decision points where human oversight, review, or approval is required before an automated process can proceed. By providing a standardized interface to pause execution and present information to a human operator, it ensures that sensitive actions, complex judgments, or high-stakes decisions receive the necessary scrutiny.

This capability is essential for building trustworthy and compliant AI systems across industries like finance, healthcare, and content moderation. Developers can use gotoHuman to create workflows where AI agents handle routine tasks but escalate exceptions, validate outputs, or request authorization for significant changes. This reduces automation risks, improves auditability, and maintains human control where it matters most, seamlessly blending AI efficiency with human judgment.
