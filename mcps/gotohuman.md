gotoHuman MCP allows developers to add a human touch to their AI applications and automations. This feature creates important moments where human input is necessary before the system moves forward with an automated task.

With a clear interface to pause and gather input from a human operator, it guarantees that sensitive actions, complex decisions, or critical judgments receive the attention they deserve.

This functionality plays a key role in developing reliable and compliant AI systems in sectors like finance, healthcare, and content moderation.

Developers can leverage gotoHuman to set up workflows where AI handles everyday tasks but calls for human review when exceptions arise, validates results, or seeks approval for significant changes. This approach lowers automation risks, enhances accountability, and keeps human oversight where it counts, effectively merging AI efficiency with human insight.
