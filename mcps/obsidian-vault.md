# Obsidian Vault

This MCP provides a comprehensive interface for managing Obsidian vaults, enabling developers to perform file operations, search content, and handle metadata programmatically. It supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes, as well as querying content with advanced search capabilities and managing frontmatter metadata. This facilitates seamless integration of Obsidian's powerful note-taking features into custom applications and workflows.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can build tools for automated knowledge base management, content synchronization, and intelligent note organization. Use cases include building custom plugins, creating content management systems that integrate with Obsidian, developing research assistants that interact with personal knowledge bases, and automating documentation workflows. The MCP enhances productivity by bringing Obsidian's flexible markdown-based organization system into programmable environments.
