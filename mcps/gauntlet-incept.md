Gauntlet Incept is an MCP server that bridges the gap between educational technology standards and modern AI capabilities. It integrates with QTI (Question and Test Interoperability) services to structure educational content according to established specifications, while leveraging large language models to dynamically generate personalized learning materials.

This enables educators and developers to create adaptive learning experiences that automatically adjust to individual students' knowledge levels, learning styles, and interests.

The MCP streamlines the entire content creation workflow, from initial assessment to personalized material generation. By analyzing student performance data and preferences, it can produce tailored quizzes, explanations, and practice exercises that target specific knowledge gaps.

This approach significantly reduces the manual effort required for differentiated instruction while improving educational outcomes through data-driven personalization. Use cases include automated tutoring systems, adaptive testing platforms, and personalized curriculum development for educational institutions and edtech companies.
