# Chain of Draft

Chain of Draft MCP provides a structured reasoning framework that generates concise intermediate steps for efficient problem-solving. By implementing both Chain of Draft (CoD) and Chain of Thought (CoT) methodologies, it enables developers to optimize token usage while maintaining reasoning quality across various domains including code generation, data analysis, and complex decision-making tasks. The system includes adaptive complexity estimation to dynamically adjust the level of detail in reasoning steps based on problem difficulty.

The MCP offers format enforcement capabilities to ensure consistent output structures and integrates seamlessly with AI development workflows. This makes it particularly valuable for applications requiring systematic reasoning with computational efficiency, such as automated code review, technical documentation generation, and multi-step problem decomposition. Developers can leverage these tools to build more reliable and scalable AI systems that balance reasoning depth with resource constraints.
