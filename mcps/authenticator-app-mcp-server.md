# Authenticator App MCP Server

The Authenticator App MCP Server provides a secure bridge between AI agents and authenticator applications, allowing automated handling of multi-factor authentication (MFA) processes. This server enables AI systems to generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), manage authentication tokens, and verify codes without compromising security. By implementing proper encryption and secure token storage, it maintains the integrity of authentication workflows while providing programmatic access to MFA functionality.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build AI-powered authentication systems, automate security testing, and create intelligent assistants that handle secure login processes. The server supports various authenticator standards and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, security automation tools, and AI-driven customer support systems. This enables more sophisticated automation while maintaining robust security practices required for modern authentication protocols.
