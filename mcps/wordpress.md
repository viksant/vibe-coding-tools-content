# WordPress

This MCP provides seamless integration with WordPress, enabling developers to programmatically manage content and administer sites through WordPress's REST API. It allows for automated post creation, content updates, media management, and site configuration tasks, eliminating the need for manual dashboard interactions. This is particularly valuable for content pipelines, multi-site management, and headless WordPress implementations.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build automated workflows for content publishing, bulk operations, and site maintenance. It supports custom post types, taxonomies, and user management, making it ideal for CMS-driven applications, content migration tools, and dynamic site generators. The API-first approach ensures reliable, scalable WordPress integration while maintaining security through proper authentication mechanisms.
