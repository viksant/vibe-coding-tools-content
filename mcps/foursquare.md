# Foursquare

The Foursquare MCP provides developers with comprehensive access to the Foursquare Places API, enabling applications to understand user locations and surrounding points of interest. This service transforms raw GPS coordinates into rich contextual data using a global database of over 100 million places across 1,500+ categories, offering detailed venue information, category classification, and proximity-based discovery.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build location-aware applications that deliver personalized recommendations, location-based services, and spatial analytics. Common use cases include mapping applications, travel guides, local search tools, and proximity-based notifications. The API's extensive categorization system and global coverage make it ideal for applications requiring accurate place data, from retail analytics to urban planning and beyond.
