# Docker Compose

This MCP provides a bridge to Docker Compose through the Docker SDK for Python, enabling developers to define, run, and manage multi-container applications with ease. It allows you to work with Compose files to orchestrate complex service dependencies, networks, and volumes in a declarative way.

With this MCP, you can start, stop, and scale services, view logs, and manage the entire application lifecycle. It's particularly valuable for development environments, testing setups, and local deployments where you need to coordinate multiple containers that work together. The integration with Docker SDK ensures reliable container management and real-time status monitoring.
