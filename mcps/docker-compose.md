This MCP acts as a connection to Docker Compose using the Docker SDK for Python. It makes it simple for developers to define, run, and manage applications that use multiple containers.

You can easily work with Compose files to organize complex service dependencies, networks, and volumes in a straightforward manner. 

With this MCP, you have the ability to start, stop, and scale services. You can also view logs and oversee the entire application lifecycle, which keeps everything running smoothly.

This tool especially shines in development environments, testing setups, and local deployments where you need to manage several containers that need to work together. 

Plus, the integration with Docker SDK provides dependable container management and lets you monitor the status in real time.
