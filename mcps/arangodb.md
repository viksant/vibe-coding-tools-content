# ArangoDB

This MCP provides seamless integration with ArangoDB, a versatile multi-model database that combines document, graph, and key-value data models. Developers can execute complex AQL (ArangoDB Query Language) queries to retrieve, filter, and analyze data across different data models within a single database instance. The MCP enables dynamic document retrieval, graph traversals, and real-time data analysis, making it ideal for applications requiring flexible data relationships and complex query patterns.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can build sophisticated data workflows that handle both structured document data and complex graph relationships. Use cases include recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, social network analysis, and any application requiring combined document and graph capabilities. The integration simplifies database operations, reduces development time, and provides powerful tools for data exploration and business intelligence.
