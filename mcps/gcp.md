# GCP

The GCP MCP server provides a seamless bridge between AI assistants and Google Cloud Platform, enabling natural language interactions with cloud resources. This allows developers and operators to query, monitor, and manage their GCP infrastructure through conversational interfaces without switching between tools or writing complex CLI commands.

This integration supports various GCP services including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and more, making cloud operations more accessible and efficient. Teams can use this for infrastructure troubleshooting, resource provisioning, cost analysis, and automated cloud management workflows through simple natural language prompts.
