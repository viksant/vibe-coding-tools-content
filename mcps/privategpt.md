This MCP server connects privateGPT with MCP-compatible applications, enabling developers to build secure, private AI-driven projects without exposing sensitive data to external services. 

It provides comprehensive chat management capabilities, allowing for persistent conversations and context-aware interactions. The server also facilitates knowledge source organization, letting teams structure and query private document collections effectively.

Key benefits include robust group-based permissions that enable fine-grained access control for different user roles and project teams. This makes it ideal for enterprise environments, research institutions, and any organization requiring confidential AI assistance. 

Use cases range from internal documentation chatbots and secure research assistants to compliance-aware customer support systems that maintain data privacy while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.
