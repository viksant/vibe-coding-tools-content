# Notes

This MCP enables AI models to create, read, update, and delete notes with persistent storage, providing reliable memory and context management for conversational applications. Built with TypeScript and DynamoDB, it offers a robust foundation for maintaining conversation history, user preferences, and application state across sessions.

Developers can integrate this MCP to build applications that remember user interactions, maintain context across conversations, and personalize experiences based on historical data. The solution supports scalable note management with efficient querying capabilities, making it ideal for chatbots, virtual assistants, and any AI-driven application requiring persistent memory.
