This MCP allows AI models to create, read, update, and delete notes while ensuring that information stays stored over time. This means it can manage memory and context effectively for conversational applications.

By using TypeScript and DynamoDB, this MCP provides a strong base for keeping track of conversation history, user preferences, and the overall application state across different sessions.

Developers can easily integrate this MCP into their applications. This integration helps them build tools that remember user interactions, keep context throughout conversations, and tailor experiences based on past data.

The solution also supports scalable note management with quick querying features, making it a great fit for chatbots, virtual assistants, or any AI application that needs reliable memory.
