# Metaplex

This MCP provides a bridge to Metaplex's extensive documentation and code repositories, specifically designed for Solana NFT development. Developers can search and retrieve critical information about token standards, smart contracts, and SDKs directly within their workflow. This streamlines the process of building NFT marketplaces, minting tools, and digital collectibles on Solana by providing instant access to authoritative resources.

The integration supports common development tasks such as querying documentation for Candy Machine, Digital Asset Standard (DAS), and other Metaplex programs. By centralizing access to Metaplex's ecosystem, it reduces context switching and accelerates development cycles. This is particularly valuable for teams building NFT-based applications, gaming assets, or digital art platforms who need reliable, up-to-date information about Solana's leading NFT framework.
