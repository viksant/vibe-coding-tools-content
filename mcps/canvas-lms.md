This MCP provides comprehensive API integration for Canvas LMS, enabling developers to automate course management, assignment workflows, and student interactions. 

You can programmatically create and update courses, manage enrollments, publish assignments, grade submissions, and sync data with external systems. This eliminates manual administrative tasks and ensures consistent course delivery across multiple sections or semesters.

Use cases include automating course setup for new terms, bulk assignment creation from templates, integrating with external grading systems, and building custom dashboards for student progress tracking. 

Educational institutions and training organizations can streamline their learning management workflows, reduce administrative overhead, and create more dynamic, data-driven learning environments.
