# Things 3

This MCP provides a seamless bridge between your development workflow and the Things 3 task management application. It allows you to create new to-dos, organize tasks into projects and areas, set deadlines, and check off completed itemsâ€”all through simple natural language instructions. This eliminates the need to manually switch contexts and interact with the Things 3 UI, keeping you focused on your code.

Beyond basic task management, the server enables powerful productivity analysis by querying your task data. You can review completed tasks over a specific period, analyze your workflow patterns, and generate summaries of your progress. This is particularly valuable for developers tracking project milestones, managing technical debt, or adhering to agile methodologies, making it an essential tool for maintaining organization and momentum in complex development cycles.
