This MCP acts as a handy link between your development work and the Things 3 task management app. You can create new to-dos, sort tasks into projects and areas, set deadlines, and mark items as done—all using straightforward natural language commands. This setup saves you from switching back and forth between your code and the Things 3 interface, allowing you to stay focused.

But it doesn’t stop at just managing tasks. The server lets you dive into your productivity by querying your task data. You can look back at completed tasks over a certain timeframe, examine your workflow patterns, and even generate summaries of your progress.

This feature is particularly useful for developers who are keeping track of project milestones, handling technical debt, or following agile practices. It becomes a key tool for staying organized and keeping your momentum going during complex development cycles.
