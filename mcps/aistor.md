The AIStor MCP server works hand in hand with MinIO's AI-optimized object storage platform, allowing AI coding agents to easily connect with cloud storage. 

Developers can manage object storage tasks through standard MCP interfaces. This makes it easier to build applications that need scalable and high-performance storage for AI projects and large datasets.

The server also supports MinIO's S3-compatible API features. This means developers can create smart data pipelines, automate storage tasks, and build AI applications that take advantage of distributed object storage.

With this setup, handling training data, model artifacts, and inference results becomes straightforward in AI development workflows.
