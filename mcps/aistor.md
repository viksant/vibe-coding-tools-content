# AIStor

The AIStor MCP server provides seamless integration with MinIO's AI-optimized object storage platform, enabling AI coding agents to interact with cloud-native storage infrastructure. Developers can programmatically manage object storage operations, including file uploads/downloads, bucket management, and data lifecycle operations through standardized MCP interfaces. This simplifies building applications that require scalable, high-performance storage for AI workloads and large datasets.

The server supports MinIO's S3-compatible API features, allowing developers to create intelligent data pipelines, automate storage management, and build AI applications that leverage distributed object storage. It enables efficient handling of training data, model artifacts, and inference results within AI development workflows.
