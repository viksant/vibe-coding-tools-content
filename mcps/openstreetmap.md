This MCP gives you direct SQL access to the entire OpenStreetMap dataset. With this access, developers can run powerful geospatial queries to pull structured information about various geographic features.

You can easily analyze location data, discover points of interest, calculate routes, and gather detailed information on roads, buildings, natural features, and administrative boundariesâ€”all using simple SQL syntax.

This tool works great for creating location-aware applications, doing geographic research, crafting custom maps, and conducting spatial analysis. 

It simplifies the process by eliminating the need for complicated GIS software setups. Instead, you get an easy SQL interface to one of the world's most extensive geographic databases. This makes advanced geospatial capabilities available to developers, no matter their skill level.
