This MCP provides direct SQL access to the complete OpenStreetMap dataset, enabling developers to perform sophisticated geospatial queries and extract structured information about geographic features. 

You can analyze location data, find points of interest, calculate routes, and extract detailed information about roads, buildings, natural features, and administrative boundaries with simple SQL syntax.

The tool is ideal for building location-aware applications, conducting geographic research, creating custom maps, and performing spatial analysis. 

It eliminates the need for complex GIS software setup by providing a straightforward SQL interface to one of the world's most comprehensive geographic databases, making advanced geospatial capabilities accessible to developers of all skill levels.
