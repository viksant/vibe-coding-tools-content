# Dynatrace MCP Server

The Dynatrace MCP Server bridges the gap between observability platforms and AI-assisted development by providing direct access to Dynatrace's comprehensive monitoring data. This integration allows developers to query real-time performance metrics, application health status, infrastructure monitoring, and business analytics through natural language commands. You can retrieve specific metrics, analyze performance trends, investigate incidents, and monitor system health without switching between tools.

This server is essential for DevOps teams, SREs, and developers who need to incorporate observability data into their daily workflows. It enables proactive monitoring, rapid incident investigation, and data-driven decision making directly within LLM environments. The MCP handles complex queries, data aggregation, and visualization while providing actionable insights through conversational interfaces, making observability data more accessible and actionable throughout the development lifecycle.
