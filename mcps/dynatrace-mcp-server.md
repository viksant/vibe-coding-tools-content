The Dynatrace MCP Server connects observability platforms with AI-assisted development, giving you direct access to Dynatrace's extensive monitoring data. 

With this integration, developers can easily query real-time performance metrics, check application health, monitor infrastructure, and analyze business data using natural language commands. You can pull specific metrics, track performance trends, investigate incidents, and keep an eye on system healthâ€”all without needing to switch between different tools.

This server plays a crucial role for DevOps teams, SREs, and developers looking to weave observability data into their daily routines. 

It supports proactive monitoring, quick incident investigations, and data-driven decision-making right within LLM environments. The MCP takes care of complex queries, data aggregation, and visualization, while offering actionable insights through conversational interfaces. This approach makes observability data easier to access and apply throughout the development process.
