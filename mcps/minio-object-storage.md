This MCP server acts as a handy bridge to MinIO object storage. It lets developers manage buckets and objects while performing file operations through a simple and standardized interface.

You can easily create or delete buckets, upload or download objects, and list files. This functionality is perfect for building and managing cloud-native applications that need scalable storage solutions.

The server also allows for real-time monitoring of the MinIO serverâ€™s health and performance metrics. This feature helps developers keep their storage infrastructure reliable and running smoothly.

This capability is especially useful for applications needing S3-compatible storage, data lakes, or backup solutions. It provides the flexibility to work with both on-premises and cloud-based MinIO setups, all while ensuring consistent API interactions no matter the environment.
