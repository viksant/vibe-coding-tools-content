# Biomart

The Biomart MCP provides a powerful interface for querying biological databases through the Biomart platform. It enables developers to programmatically access and retrieve complex biological data such as gene annotations, protein sequences, genomic coordinates, and functional information using the pybiomart Python package. This integration abstracts away the complexities of direct API interactions and provides a clean, Pythonic interface for bioinformatics workflows.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications that require biological data integration, such as genomic analysis tools, research platforms, or data pipelines. Common use cases include translating gene identifiers between different databases, exploring available datasets across multiple organisms, and retrieving comprehensive gene information for downstream analysis. The MCP streamlines bioinformatics development by providing reliable access to curated biological data sources without requiring deep expertise in the underlying Biomart web services.
