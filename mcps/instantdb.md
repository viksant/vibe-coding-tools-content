# InstantDB

The InstantDB MCP enables seamless integration with InstantDB's database platform, allowing developers to build and maintain database applications without context switching. You can create new databases, manage existing schemas, update records, and perform complex queries directly through your AI-powered editor. This streamlines database development workflows and ensures your AI assistant has full context about your data structures and relationships.
