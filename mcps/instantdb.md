The InstantDB MCP makes it easy to connect with InstantDB's database platform. This means developers can build and manage database applications without flipping between different tools.

With this setup, you can create new databases, handle existing schemas, update records, and run complex queries right from your AI editor. 

This approach simplifies your database development process and ensures your AI assistant understands your data structures and relationships fully.
