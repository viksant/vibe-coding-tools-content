# Cribl

This MCP server creates a seamless connection between AI systems and Cribl's observability pipeline platform. It enables AI agents to query, configure, and manage Cribl's data processing workflows through natural language commands. Agents can inspect pipeline configurations, modify routing rules, monitor data flows, and troubleshoot logging issues programmatically. This integration allows organizations to automate their observability operations, optimize data routing decisions, and maintain consistent logging policies across distributed systems through intelligent automation.
