This MCP server builds a smooth link between AI systems and Cribl's observability pipeline platform. 

It lets AI agents use natural language commands to ask questions, set up, and manage Cribl's data processing workflows. With this setup, agents can check pipeline configurations, change routing rules, keep an eye on data flows, and fix logging issuesâ€”all through programming.

This integration helps organizations automate their observability tasks, make better data routing choices, and ensure consistent logging policies across their distributed systems with smart automation.
