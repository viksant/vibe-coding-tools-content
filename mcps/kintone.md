# Kintone

This MCP provides seamless integration with Kintone's REST API, enabling developers to programmatically interact with Kintone applications for data management and automation tasks. It supports core operations including retrieving records, creating new entries, updating existing data, and triggering workflow automation processes within Kintone's low-code environment.

The integration empowers developers to build custom solutions that extend Kintone's capabilities, automate business processes, and synchronize data with external systems. Use cases include building custom reporting dashboards, automating data imports from external sources, creating complex workflow triggers, and developing integrations with other enterprise systems while leveraging Kintone's user-friendly low-code platform as the foundation.
