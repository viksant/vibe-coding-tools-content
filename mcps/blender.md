BlenderMCP brings Claude AI right into Blender's 3D creation suite using the Model Context Protocol. 

With this connection, you can enjoy AI-assisted features for 3D modeling, scene composition, object manipulation, and animation. 

Now, developers and designers can simply use natural language prompts to craft intricate 3D scenes, tweak models, and automate those repetitive tasks that often slow down the creative process in Blender.
