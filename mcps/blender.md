# Blender

BlenderMCP connects Claude AI directly to Blender's 3D creation suite through the Model Context Protocol. This integration enables AI-assisted 3D modeling, scene composition, object manipulation, and animation workflows. Developers and designers can use natural language prompts to create complex 3D scenes, modify models, and automate repetitive tasks within Blender's powerful ecosystem.
