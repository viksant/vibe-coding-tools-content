The Shiprocket MCP server helps developers automate shipping processes by connecting directly to the Shiprocket platform. With this MCP, you get a set of powerful APIs that cover the entire shipping journey, from creating orders to tracking deliveries. This means businesses can manage their logistics more smoothly and programmatically.

Developers can use this MCP to track orders through various identifiers, like the AWB number, Shiprocket Order ID, or Source Order ID. Plus, they can easily compare shipping rates from different courier partners, helping them find the quickest or most affordable shipping options based on location.

This integration works great for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and logistics applications that need automated shipping solutions with real-time tracking and optimized carrier options.
