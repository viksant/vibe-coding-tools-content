The Shiprocket MCP server enables developers to automate end-to-end shipping workflows by integrating directly with the Shiprocket platform. This MCP provides comprehensive APIs for managing the entire shipping journey, from order creation to delivery tracking, allowing businesses to streamline their logistics operations programmatically.

Developers can leverage this MCP to track orders using multiple identifiers (AWB number, Shiprocket Order ID, or Source Order ID). They can compare shipping rates across courier partners and identify the fastest or most cost-effective shipping options based on location data.

This integration is ideal for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, and logistics applications that require automated shipping solutions with real-time tracking and carrier optimization capabilities.
