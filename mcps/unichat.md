Unichat offers developers a straightforward way to connect with several large language model providers through a single, user-friendly API. Gone are the days of juggling different SDKs, authentication processes, and response formats for each provider.

With Unichat, developers can write their code once and smoothly switch between providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and more, all without altering their application logic.

The Model Connection Protocol (MCP) opens up exciting possibilities, such as A/B testing various models, creating backup plans when one provider is down, and comparing the output quality from different sources.

It also streamlines model management by taking care of API key rotation, rate limiting, and error handling behind the scenes. This feature is especially useful for applications that demand high reliability, cost savings, or performance comparisons across different AI services.
