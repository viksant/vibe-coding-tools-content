# Unichat

Unichat provides developers with a single, consistent API interface to interact with multiple large language model providers simultaneously. This eliminates the need to learn and implement different SDKs, authentication methods, and response formats for each provider. Developers can write code once and easily switch between providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and others without changing their application logic.

The MCP enables advanced use cases such as A/B testing different models, implementing fallback strategies when one provider is unavailable, and comparing output quality across providers. It simplifies model management by handling API key rotation, rate limiting, and error handling transparently. This is particularly valuable for applications requiring high reliability, cost optimization, or performance benchmarking across multiple AI services.
