# WeGene

The WeGene MCP enables developers to programmatically access comprehensive genetic data through WeGene's API, allowing for sophisticated analysis of users' DNA reports. This integration provides raw genetic data, health predispositions, ancestry breakdowns, and trait information that can be used to build personalized health applications, ancestry research tools, and wellness platforms.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create applications that offer personalized health recommendations, ancestry visualization, genetic risk assessment, and trait analysis. The API supports various genetic data formats and provides structured responses that can be easily integrated into healthtech applications, research platforms, and personalized medicine solutions, enabling data-driven insights into users' genetic makeup.
