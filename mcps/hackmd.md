# HackMD

The HackMD MCP server provides a robust integration between HackMD's collaborative note-taking platform and AI assistants, enabling developers to leverage their documentation and notes within AI-powered workflows. This server allows AI systems to read, analyze, and interact with HackMD content, making collaborative documentation immediately accessible for AI-assisted coding, research, and knowledge management.

Developers can use this integration to enhance their documentation practices by having AI assistants help organize notes, generate summaries, extract insights, or even assist in creating technical documentation based on existing HackMD content. The server maintains proper authentication and access controls while providing a structured interface for AI systems to work with markdown-based collaborative content, bridging the gap between human collaboration and AI augmentation.
