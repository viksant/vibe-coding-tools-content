# WHOIS

This MCP provides programmatic access to WHOIS data, enabling developers to query domain registration information directly within their applications. It handles the complexities of WHOIS protocol communication, parsing responses from different registrars, and normalizing data into structured formats. This eliminates the need for manual lookups or dealing with inconsistent WHOIS server responses across various top-level domains.

Developers can use this MCP to build domain monitoring tools, verify domain ownership, conduct cybersecurity investigations, or automate compliance checks. The service supports bulk queries, rate limiting handling, and provides reliable access to critical domain metadata including creation dates, expiration times, registrar details, and contact information when available. This makes it invaluable for SaaS platforms, security applications, and any system requiring domain intelligence.
