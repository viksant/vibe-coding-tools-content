# VCD Waveform Analyzer

The VCD Waveform Analyzer MCP enables developers to programmatically query and analyze Value Change Dump (VCD) waveform data, which is the standard format for digital simulation outputs. This tool provides powerful capabilities for extracting signal transitions, measuring timing parameters, detecting glitches, and performing statistical analysis on digital waveforms. It transforms raw simulation data into actionable insights for debugging and verification workflows.

Developers can use this MCP to automate hardware verification tasks, validate timing constraints, and perform signal integrity analysis across multiple test scenarios. It's particularly valuable for FPGA/ASIC design verification, where engineers need to analyze complex digital behaviors across millions of simulation cycles. The analyzer supports filtering by signal hierarchy, time ranges, and value patterns, making it essential for efficient digital design validation and regression testing.
