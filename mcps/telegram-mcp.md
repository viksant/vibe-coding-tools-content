# Telegram MCP

Telegram MCP provides comprehensive API integration for Telegram, enabling developers to programmatically access user data, manage various dialog types (chats, channels, groups), and retrieve messages with full metadata. The server handles read status management, message synchronization, and real-time updates, making it ideal for building Telegram bots, automation workflows, and data extraction tools.

This MCP simplifies complex Telegram API interactions by providing a clean, standardized interface that handles authentication, rate limiting, and error management. Developers can focus on building features rather than dealing with API complexities, enabling rapid development of communication tools, notification systems, and social media integrations that leverage Telegram's extensive messaging capabilities.
