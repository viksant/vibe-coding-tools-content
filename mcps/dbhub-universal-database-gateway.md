# DBHub (Universal Database Gateway)

DBHub MCP provides a unified interface for connecting to multiple database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and DuckDB. This gateway enables developers to browse database tables, inspect schemas, and execute read-only SQL queries across different database technologies without switching between specialized tools. The built-in safety checks ensure that only SELECT queries are executed, preventing accidental data modification or destructive operations.

This MCP is particularly valuable for database exploration, data analysis, and debugging workflows where developers need to quickly inspect database structures or retrieve sample data. It supports cross-database operations, making it ideal for applications that work with multiple database backends or for teams maintaining heterogeneous database environments. The universal approach reduces the learning curve and toolchain complexity associated with managing different database systems.
