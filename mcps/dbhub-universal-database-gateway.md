DBHub MCP offers a simple way to connect with various database systems like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and DuckDB. 

With this handy gateway, developers can easily browse tables, check out schemas, and run read-only SQL queries across different database technologiesâ€”all without the hassle of switching between different tools. The built-in safety checks ensure that only SELECT queries get executed, which helps avoid any accidental changes or data mishaps.

This MCP shines when it comes to exploring databases, analyzing data, and debugging workflows. Developers can quickly inspect database structures or pull sample data when needed.

It also supports cross-database operations, making it a great choice for applications that use multiple database backends or for teams handling diverse database environments. This universal approach simplifies the process and makes it easier for everyone to manage different database systems.
