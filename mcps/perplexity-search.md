# Perplexity Search

This MCP integrates Perplexity's powerful search API directly into Claude, providing real-time web search functionality that automatically selects the optimal AI model based on query intent. It intelligently analyzes search queries to determine whether they require general knowledge, technical documentation, or current events, then routes them to the most appropriate Perplexity model for accurate, context-aware results.

The integration supports customizable domain filtering, allowing developers to restrict searches to specific websites or knowledge bases, and recency filtering to prioritize up-to-date information. This is particularly valuable for developers needing to search technical documentation, API references, or recent code examples without leaving their Claude workflow. The MCP handles API authentication and error management, providing a seamless search experience that enhances Claude's knowledge with current web information while maintaining conversation context.
