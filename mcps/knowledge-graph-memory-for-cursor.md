# Knowledge Graph Memory for Cursor

The Knowledge Graph Memory MCP Server introduces advanced memory capabilities to MCP clients, including popular IDEs like Cursor, by leveraging the Graphiti framework for dynamic, temporal knowledge graphs. Unlike traditional RAG systems that require full recomputation, this solution incrementally integrates interactions and data, enabling efficient querying and context preservation without performance overhead. This approach allows AI agents and development tools to maintain persistent, evolving knowledge structures that reflect the temporal nature of development workflows.

The server enables developers to build more intelligent and context-aware development environments by providing structured memory that grows and adapts over time. This is particularly valuable for complex projects where maintaining context across multiple sessions and interactions is crucial. The temporal knowledge graph architecture ensures that historical data remains accessible and queryable while new information is seamlessly integrated, creating a comprehensive memory system for development tools.
