This MCP server transforms web content into high-quality Markdown format by leveraging Mozilla's Readability library to extract meaningful content from URLs or HTML files, followed by TurndownService for clean conversion. 

The tool intelligently strips away boilerplate elements like navigation menus, ads, and scripts, preserving only the core article text, headings, lists, and links in a structured Markdown format that's ideal for documentation, analysis, and archival purposes.

Developers can use this converter to build content aggregation pipelines, create documentation from web sources, prepare training data for AI models, or migrate web content to Markdown-based systems. 

The conversion maintains semantic structure while producing clean, readable output that integrates seamlessly with modern documentation workflows and content management systems.
