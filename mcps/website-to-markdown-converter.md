This MCP server takes web content and turns it into high-quality Markdown format. It uses Mozilla's Readability library to pull out the important bits from URLs or HTML files. Then, it employs TurndownService for a tidy conversion.

Hereâ€™s how it works: the tool smartly removes unnecessary elements like navigation menus, ads, and scripts. What you get is just the essential article text, headings, lists, and links, all organized in a Markdown format. This format is perfect for documentation, analysis, and archiving.

Developers can tap into this converter to create content aggregation pipelines, generate documentation from web sources, prepare training data for AI models, or shift web content to Markdown-based systems.

The conversion keeps the semantic structure intact while ensuring the output is clean and easy to read. This makes it a great fit for modern documentation workflows and content management systems.
