# Simple Timeserver

The Simple Timeserver MCP provides developers with reliable time data services, offering both local and UTC time information with high accuracy. This enables applications to maintain proper time synchronization across different timezones and handle time-sensitive operations effectively.

Developers can use this MCP to build scheduling systems, event management applications, and time-based automation tools that require precise timing. The service ensures consistent timekeeping for distributed systems, logging mechanisms, and any application where accurate timestamping is critical for functionality and compliance.
