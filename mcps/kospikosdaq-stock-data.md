This MCP server opens up easy access to South Korea's main stock markets, KOSPI and KOSDAQ, thanks to its integration with the pykrx library.

Developers can grab real-time and historical market data, including ticker symbols, OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, market capitalization figures, fundamental indicators, and detailed trading volume stats. The server takes care of authentication and data normalization, so users get clean, structured financial data that's ready for analysis.

This MCP is perfect for creating financial applications, trading algorithms, market analysis tools, and investment research platforms. It lets developers concentrate on their core logic without getting bogged down in data acquisition challenges.

Plus, it supports real-time monitoring and historical backtesting. This makes it a great resource for quantitative analysts, fintech developers, and financial researchers diving into the Korean equity markets.
