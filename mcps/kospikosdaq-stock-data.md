# KOSPI/KOSDAQ Stock Data

This MCP server provides comprehensive access to South Korea's primary stock markets (KOSPI and KOSDAQ) through seamless integration with the pykrx library. Developers can retrieve real-time and historical market data including ticker symbols, OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, market capitalization metrics, fundamental indicators, and detailed trading volume statistics. The server handles authentication and data normalization, delivering clean, structured financial data ready for analysis.

Ideal for building financial applications, trading algorithms, market analysis tools, and investment research platforms, this MCP enables developers to focus on their core logic rather than data acquisition complexities. It supports both real-time monitoring and historical backtesting scenarios, making it valuable for quantitative analysts, fintech developers, and financial researchers working with Korean equity markets.
