The APISIX Model Context Protocol (MCP) server connects large language models (LLMs) with the APISIX Admin API. This connection lets developers manage their API gateway using natural language commands.

With this setup, you can easily handle routes, services, upstreams, and plugins without needing to dive deep into the technical details of the API syntax. Want to check the status of your gateway, tweak some settings, or troubleshoot? You can do all of this simply by chatting with MCP-compatible AI clients.

This protocol lightens the mental load and makes learning API gateway administration much easier. Teams can enhance their API management by using straightforward language prompts for everyday tasks, such as creating new routes, adjusting plugin settings, or keeping an eye on traffic.

The MCP also supports real-time interactions, which is perfect for fast-paced environments where quick changes are a must. Plus, it keeps the security and reliability of the APISIX platform intact.
