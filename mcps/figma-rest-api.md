# Figma REST API

This MCP provides a robust interface to the Figma REST API, allowing developers to programmatically interact with design assets and systems. It enables automation of common design operations such as fetching component libraries, managing design tokens, and handling file versions. Developers can streamline workflows by integrating design updates directly into their development pipelines, ensuring consistency between design and code.

The MCP supports collaborative workflows by facilitating real-time synchronization between design and engineering teams. Use cases include automated extraction of design variables for code generation, batch processing of design files, and maintaining version control across design systems. This integration helps bridge the gap between design and development, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors in the design-to-code translation process.
