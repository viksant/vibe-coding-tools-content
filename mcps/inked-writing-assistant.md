Inked is a unique tool that changes how we create long documents. It offers conversation-based features that help with drafting, editing, and polishing extensive content.

Writers and developers can tackle complex projects like novels, technical reports, and research papers more easily. By engaging in iterative discussions, they make the writing process more collaborative and manageable.

This tool supports organized workflows for outlining, drafting different versions, and making revisions based on feedback. It helps lighten the mental load that often comes with big writing tasks.

This approach is especially useful for technical writers, authors, and researchers who need to keep their documents consistent and coherent while adapting to changing requirements and feedback.
