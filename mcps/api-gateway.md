API Gateway MCP makes it easy for developers to integrate any REST API into their AI assistant workflow using OpenAPI/Swagger specifications. You donâ€™t have to worry about manual API calls or additional coding. Just describe your goals in natural language, and the AI takes care of the API communication for you.

This tool can handle multiple APIs at once and allows for custom headers, making it perfect for complex backend tasks.

Deploying API Gateway is a breeze with its Docker-based setup that runs in seconds. It works well with Claude Desktop and Cursor environments, turning your AI assistant into a capable backend operator that can execute real API requests across different services.

Now, developers can automate workflows, test endpoints, and engage with their entire API ecosystem through conversational interfaces. This approach speeds up both development and testing cycles significantly.
