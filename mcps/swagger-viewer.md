# swagger-viewer

The Swagger Viewer MCP provides seamless integration with Swagger/OpenAPI documentation within the Cursor editor environment. Developers can quickly access API specifications, explore endpoints, view request/response schemas, and test API calls without leaving their development workflow. This tool enhances productivity by eliminating context switching between documentation and code, making API exploration and implementation more efficient for teams working with RESTful services.
