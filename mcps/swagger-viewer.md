The Swagger Viewer MCP brings together Swagger/OpenAPI documentation right inside the Cursor editor. 

With this tool, developers can easily access API specifications, check out endpoints, view request and response schemas, and even test API callsâ€”all without stepping out of their development environment. 

This setup boosts productivity by cutting down on the hassle of switching between documentation and code, making it easier for teams to explore and implement APIs for RESTful services.
