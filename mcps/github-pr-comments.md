# GitHub PR Comments

This MCP integrates with GitHub's Pull Request system to provide comprehensive access to PR comments, including their associated file paths, line ranges, and reply threads. It enables developers to programmatically retrieve and analyze feedback across code reviews, making it easier to track discussions, identify patterns in feedback, and automate review-related tasks.

By exposing detailed comment metadata alongside code context, this MCP supports seamless integration into code review tools, CI/CD pipelines, and developer workflows. It helps teams maintain higher code quality through better visibility into review feedback and enables automation of common review processes like generating summary reports or triggering specific actions based on comment content.
