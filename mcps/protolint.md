# protolint

Protolint is a comprehensive linting tool specifically designed for Protocol Buffer (.proto) files that helps developers maintain consistent code quality and adherence to best practices. It offers an extensive set of configurable rules covering naming conventions, proper indentation, import organization, field ordering, and semantic validation. The tool can automatically fix many common issues while providing clear error messages and suggestions for manual corrections.

By integrating Protolint into development workflows, teams can ensure their protobuf schemas follow consistent standards across projects, reduce syntax errors, and improve overall code maintainability. It supports both command-line usage and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making it an essential tool for any project using Protocol Buffers for data serialization and API definitions.
