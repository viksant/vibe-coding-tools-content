The Squad AI MCP server bridges the gap between AI assistants and product strategy workflows by providing direct access to Squad's comprehensive product-discovery platform. 

This integration allows developers and product teams to interact with product strategy artifacts—including opportunities, solutions, outcomes, requirements, knowledge bases, workspaces, and feedback—through natural language commands within their preferred AI copilot environment.

With this MCP, teams can create, query, and update product strategy elements seamlessly, enabling real-time collaboration and decision-making. 

The server supports complex product management operations like opportunity analysis, requirement tracking, and feedback aggregation, making it ideal for product managers, developers, and strategists who need to maintain product alignment while leveraging AI assistance for accelerated discovery and planning cycles.
