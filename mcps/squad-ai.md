The Squad AI MCP server connects AI assistants with product strategy workflows, giving you direct access to Squad's all-in-one product-discovery platform. 

This integration makes it easy for developers and product teams to work with important product strategy materials—like opportunities, solutions, outcomes, requirements, knowledge bases, workspaces, and feedback—using simple natural language commands right in their favorite AI copilot environment.

With this MCP, teams can easily create, query, and update product strategy elements, which boosts real-time collaboration and decision-making. 

The server also handles complex product management tasks such as opportunity analysis, requirement tracking, and feedback aggregation. This makes it a great fit for product managers, developers, and strategists who want to keep their products aligned while using AI support to speed up discovery and planning processes.
