# Perplexity Research Assistant

The Perplexity Research Assistant MCP connects developers directly to the Perplexity Sonar Pro API, offering powerful real-time research capabilities within their development workflow. This integration enables instant access to comprehensive documentation, API discovery, and intelligent code analysis, significantly reducing the time spent searching for technical information across multiple sources.

Developers can leverage this MCP to quickly find relevant documentation, discover appropriate APIs for their projects, and get detailed code analysis insights. This is particularly valuable for rapid prototyping, learning new technologies, debugging complex issues, and staying current with best practices. The assistant provides context-aware responses that help developers make informed decisions faster, ultimately accelerating development cycles and improving code quality.
