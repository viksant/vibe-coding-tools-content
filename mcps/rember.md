# Rember

The Rember MCP brings spaced repetition-based learning directly into your development environment. It allows you to programmatically create, manage, and review flashcards for any subjectâ€”whether you're studying new programming languages, preparing for certifications, or memorizing key concepts. The MCP automates review scheduling based on proven spaced repetition algorithms, ensuring optimal retention with minimal effort. Developers can integrate learning workflows into their daily routines, build custom study applications, or even create interactive tutorials. This turns your IDE or CLI into a powerful learning companion that adapts to your memory patterns over time.
