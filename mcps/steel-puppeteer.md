# Steel Puppeteer

Steel Puppeteer MCP bridges AI capabilities with web browser automation by leveraging Puppeteer and Steel's robust automation platform. This integration allows developers to programmatically control headless Chrome/Chromium browsers, enabling complex web interactions, dynamic content handling, and seamless automation of repetitive tasks. The MCP provides a structured interface for AI agents to execute browser-based operations with precision and reliability.

Developers can use Steel Puppeteer for a wide range of applications including automated data extraction from dynamic websites, end-to-end testing of web applications, and orchestrating multi-step workflows that involve web interactions. The tool handles JavaScript rendering, form submissions, and user interactions, making it ideal for scenarios requiring real browser context. By combining AI decision-making with browser automation, it significantly reduces manual effort in web scraping, monitoring, and process automation projects.
