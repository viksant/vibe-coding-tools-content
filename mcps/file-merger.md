The File Merger MCP is a handy tool for developers looking to combine multiple files into one. With a structured API, it makes the merging process straightforward and efficient. 

This tool offers different strategies for merging, such as simple concatenation, which just stacks files together, and content-aware merging that tailors the process for specific file types. It even includes ways to resolve conflicts, so you won’t run into issues when files don’t match up.

It works with popular file formats like text files, code files, configuration files, and structured data formats. This versatility means you can use it in a variety of situations.

You might find this MCP especially useful for tasks like code generation, managing builds, handling configurations, or processing data. For instance, you can automate the combination of several JavaScript files into one bundle, merge configuration snippets from different sources, or even gather log files and reports in one place.

The API also lets you customize how files merge. You can set up your own delimiters, add headers and footers, and choose how to handle duplicates. This makes it perfect for everything from straightforward file concatenation to more complex multi-file projects.
