The File Merger MCP enables developers to programmatically combine multiple files into a single output file through a structured API. This tool supports various merging strategies including simple concatenation, content-aware merging for specific file types, and conflict resolution mechanisms. 

It handles common file formats like text files, code files, configuration files, and structured data formats, providing flexibility for different use cases.

This MCP is particularly valuable for code generation, build processes, configuration management, and data processing workflows. Developers can automate tasks like combining multiple JavaScript files into a bundle, merging configuration fragments from different sources, or aggregating log files and reports.

The API provides options for custom delimiters, header/footer injection, and duplicate handling, making it suitable for both simple file concatenation and complex multi-file composition scenarios.
