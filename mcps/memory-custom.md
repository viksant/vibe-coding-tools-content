# Memory Custom

Memory Custom MCP provides a sophisticated knowledge graph-based memory system that enables developers to create, manage, and query structured information with enterprise-grade features. The system supports custom file path configurations for flexible data organization, automatic timestamping for temporal tracking, and advanced search capabilities including semantic queries and relationship traversal. This allows for intelligent information retrieval and context-aware data management.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications requiring persistent structured memory, such as AI assistants with long-term context, knowledge management systems, or data analysis tools. The knowledge graph foundation enables complex relationship mapping between entities, making it ideal for scenarios where understanding connections between data points is crucial. Benefits include improved data organization, efficient query performance, and the ability to maintain historical context across sessions.
