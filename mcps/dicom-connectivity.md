# DICOM Connectivity

The DICOM Connectivity MCP provides developers with tools to integrate and test medical imaging systems using the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) protocol. This MCP enables essential operations like node discovery, C-ECHO connectivity testing, and configuration management for DICOM nodes, allowing developers to verify system interoperability and diagnose communication issues in healthcare imaging workflows.

By offering programmatic access to DICOM connectivity functions, this MCP helps developers build robust medical imaging applications that require reliable communication between PACS systems, imaging modalities, and healthcare IT infrastructure. It supports healthcare interoperability standards and simplifies the development of diagnostic tools, quality assurance systems, and integration platforms for medical imaging environments.
