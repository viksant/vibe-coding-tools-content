# HANA Cloud ML Bridge

The HANA Cloud ML Bridge provides a structured three-layer architecture that seamlessly integrates SAP HANA Cloud databases with machine learning operations. This MCP enables comprehensive model management, execution context handling, and standardized communication protocols for both inference and training workflows. It bridges the gap between enterprise data storage and ML pipelines, allowing developers to operationalize machine learning directly within their HANA environment.

By providing standardized interfaces and execution contexts, this bridge simplifies the deployment and management of ML models while ensuring data consistency and workflow reproducibility. Developers can leverage HANA's in-memory computing capabilities for real-time inference and efficient data processing during training phases. The architecture supports scalable ML operations, making it ideal for enterprise applications requiring tight integration between database operations and machine learning workflows.
