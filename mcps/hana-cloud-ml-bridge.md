The HANA Cloud ML Bridge offers a clear three-layer structure that connects SAP HANA Cloud databases with machine learning operations.

This platform allows for effective model management, handles execution contexts, and uses standardized communication protocols for both inference and training. It effectively links enterprise data storage to machine learning pipelines, enabling developers to implement machine learning right in their HANA environment.

With its standardized interfaces and execution contexts, the bridge streamlines the deployment and management of ML models. It also helps maintain data consistency and ensures that workflows are reproducible.

Developers can take advantage of HANA's in-memory computing for real-time inference and efficient data processing during training. The architecture is designed to support scalable machine learning operations, making it a great fit for enterprise applications that need a close connection between database tasks and machine learning workflows.
