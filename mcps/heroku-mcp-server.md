# Heroku MCP Server

The Heroku MCP Server provides a specialized interface that allows large language models to directly interact with the Heroku cloud platform. This enables AI assistants to read application status, manage deployments, scale dynos, configure environment variables, and monitor performance metrics through automated API calls. Developers can use this integration to streamline DevOps workflows, automate routine platform operations, and receive intelligent recommendations for application optimization and troubleshooting.
