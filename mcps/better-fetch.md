# Better Fetch

Better Fetch is a powerful MCP server designed to intelligently retrieve and process web content with advanced nested URL crawling capabilities. It transforms any documentation site or web resource into clean, structured markdown files optimized for AI consumption and analysis. The server handles complex website structures, extracts meaningful content while filtering out noise, and produces well-formatted markdown that preserves the original information hierarchy.

This tool is particularly valuable for developers working with AI systems that need to process technical documentation, API references, or knowledge bases. It enables automated content ingestion from web sources, supports batch processing of multiple URLs, and ensures consistent formatting for reliable AI parsing. The result is a streamlined workflow where web content becomes immediately usable for AI-assisted development, research, and documentation analysis.
