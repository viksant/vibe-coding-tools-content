# Babashka

This MCP server integrates with Babashka, a fast-starting Clojure interpreter designed for scripting and command-line tasks. It enables dynamic execution of Clojure code, allowing developers to write scripts for automation, data transformation, and system administration without the startup overhead of traditional JVM-based Clojure. The server provides interactive capabilities for evaluating Clojure expressions, running scripts, and managing Babashka tasks programmatically.

Developers can leverage this integration to build powerful automation workflows, process data pipelines, and create custom CLI tools using Clojure's expressive syntax and rich ecosystem. It's particularly valuable for DevOps tasks, data processing scripts, and rapid prototyping where the combination of Clojure's functional programming strengths and Babashka's instant startup time provides significant productivity benefits over traditional scripting languages.
