# Infura MCP Server

The Infura MCP Server provides a standardized interface for Large Language Models to interact with the Ethereum blockchain through Infura's robust JSON-RPC API. This enables developers to leverage AI assistants for blockchain operations like querying blockchain data, checking transaction statuses, reading smart contract states, and monitoring network activity without needing deep Ethereum protocol expertise.

By abstracting the complexity of direct JSON-RPC calls, this MCP server accelerates blockchain development workflows. Developers can use natural language commands to deploy smart contracts, analyze transaction histories, monitor gas prices, and interact with decentralized applications. This is particularly valuable for prototyping, debugging, and educational purposes where rapid iteration and exploration of blockchain data are essential.
