# YNAB

The YNAB MCP provides developers with seamless integration to the You Need A Budget (YNAB) API, enabling programmatic access to personal finance data and operations. This tool allows applications to retrieve account balances, transaction histories, and detailed budget information, facilitating real-time financial analysis and automated money management workflows. Developers can build custom financial dashboards, automate expense tracking, and create personalized budgeting tools that sync directly with YNAB's powerful budgeting framework.

By supporting transaction creation and budget data access, this MCP empowers developers to create sophisticated financial planning applications. Use cases include automated bill payment systems, financial health monitors, spending analysis tools, and integration with other financial platforms. The API integration ensures data consistency and provides a reliable foundation for building applications that help users achieve better financial control and insights through automated, data-driven budgeting strategies.
