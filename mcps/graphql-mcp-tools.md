GraphQL MCP Tools acts as a Model Context Protocol server, making it easier for AI assistants to communicate with GraphQL APIs using a consistent set of tools.

Let's break it down. This server allows for schema introspection, query execution, mutation operations, and real-time subscriptions. Developers can use either natural language or structured commands to interact with GraphQL, which streamlines the process.

This setup improves development workflows by automating tasks like API exploration, testing, and integration. As a result, teams can cut down on manual work and reduce the chances of errors.

This tool is especially beneficial for teams creating GraphQL-based applications. It helps speed up development and ensures that everyone stays consistent in how they consume APIs.
