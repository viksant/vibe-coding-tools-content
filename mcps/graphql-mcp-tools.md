# GraphQL MCP Tools

GraphQL MCP Tools is a Model Context Protocol server that empowers AI assistants to interact seamlessly with GraphQL APIs through a standardized set of tools. It facilitates schema introspection, query execution, mutation operations, and real-time subscriptions, allowing developers to leverage natural language or structured commands for GraphQL interactions. This server enhances development workflows by automating API exploration, testing, and integration tasks, reducing manual effort and potential errors. It's particularly valuable for teams building GraphQL-based applications who want to accelerate development and maintain consistency across their API consumption patterns.
