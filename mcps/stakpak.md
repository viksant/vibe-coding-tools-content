# Stakpak

The Stakpak MCP integrates with the Stakpak API to automate infrastructure code generation, allowing developers to quickly create and manage project configurations through a dedicated tool that works seamlessly across various integrated development environments. This eliminates the need for manual coding of infrastructure setups, reducing errors and accelerating development cycles.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can generate configurations for multiple cloud platforms and services, ensuring consistency and best practices across projects. It supports use cases such as rapid prototyping, CI/CD pipeline setup, and multi-environment deployments, making it ideal for teams adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodologies. The tool enhances productivity by providing a unified interface for infrastructure management within familiar development workflows.
