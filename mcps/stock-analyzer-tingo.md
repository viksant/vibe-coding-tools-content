# Stock Analyzer (Tingo)

The Stock Analyzer (Tingo) MCP enables developers to build sophisticated stock analysis applications by providing direct access to Tiingo's financial data API. This tool delivers real-time and historical market data, allowing for the calculation of essential technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands. Developers can automate trading strategies, backtest algorithms, and create data-driven investment tools with reliable, clean financial data.

By integrating this MCP, developers can focus on building their application logic rather than managing data pipelines or ensuring data quality. It supports various use cases including algorithmic trading platforms, portfolio management dashboards, and financial research tools. The MCP handles authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization, making it easier to develop robust financial applications that require accurate and timely market analysis for informed trading decisions.
