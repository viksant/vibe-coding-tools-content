# Sentry

This MCP provides direct integration with Sentry.io, enabling developers to retrieve, analyze, and monitor application errors and performance issues in real-time. It allows for querying error events, stack traces, and performance metrics directly from Sentry's API, helping teams identify and prioritize critical issues affecting their applications.

The integration supports automated error tracking, trend analysis, and alert configuration, making it easier to maintain application health and improve user experience. Developers can use this MCP to streamline debugging workflows, correlate errors with deployment events, and generate detailed reports for team collaboration and post-mortem analysis.
