This MCP connects directly with Sentry.io, giving developers the tools they need to spot, analyze, and track application errors and performance issues as they happen.

With this integration, teams can easily query error events, stack traces, and performance metrics right from Sentry's API. This capability helps them pinpoint and prioritize the critical issues that impact their applications.

The integration also features automated error tracking, trend analysis, and alert configuration. These tools simplify the task of keeping applications healthy and enhancing user experience.

Developers can leverage this MCP to make their debugging workflows more efficient. They can link errors to deployment events and create detailed reports, which help with team collaboration and post-mortem analysis.
