# GNews

The GNews MCP provides seamless integration with the GNews API, enabling developers to programmatically access and retrieve news content from thousands of global sources. This MCP supports comprehensive news search capabilities, headline fetching for specific countries or languages, and topic-based article retrieval across diverse categories like business, technology, sports, and entertainment. Developers can filter results by publication date, language preference, and geographic region to obtain highly relevant news data.

This integration is particularly valuable for building news aggregation platforms, content curation tools, market intelligence dashboards, and AI-powered applications that require real-time news context. By abstracting the complexities of the GNews API, this MCP accelerates development of applications that need reliable news data feeds while handling rate limiting, error management, and response parsing automatically. It enables creation of intelligent systems that can monitor news trends, perform sentiment analysis, or provide contextual information based on current events.
