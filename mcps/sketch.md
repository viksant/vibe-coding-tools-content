This MCP server bridges the gap between design and development by providing AI coding agents like Cursor with direct access to Sketch layout information. 

It enables AI assistants to read design specifications, extract precise measurements, understand component hierarchies, and translate visual designs into accurate code implementations.

Developers can use this MCP to automate UI development workflows, ensuring pixel-perfect implementation of designs without manual measurement or specification transfer. 

The server supports real-time design updates, component inspection, and layout analysis, making it invaluable for teams practicing design-system-driven development or working with complex UI requirements across multiple platforms.
