This MCP server connects design and development by allowing AI coding agents, such as Cursor, to access Sketch layout information directly. 

With this setup, AI assistants can read design specifications, pull precise measurements, grasp component hierarchies, and convert visual designs into accurate code. 

Developers can take advantage of this MCP to streamline their UI development workflows. This means they can achieve pixel-perfect design implementations without needing to measure or transfer specifications manually. 

The server also supports real-time design updates, component inspection, and layout analysis. This feature is a game changer for teams that focus on design-system-driven development or deal with complex UI needs across various platforms.
