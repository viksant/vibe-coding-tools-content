# YouTube Watch Later

This MCP provides developers with programmatic access to YouTube's Watch Later functionality through the official YouTube API. It enables automated management of video playlists, including adding/removing videos, organizing content by categories or priorities, and implementing smart curation features based on user preferences or viewing history. Developers can build applications that automatically sort recommended content, create themed collections from saved videos, or integrate Watch Later management into larger content workflow systems.

The tool is particularly valuable for content creators, educators, and media platforms that need to manage video collections at scale. Use cases include building personalized recommendation engines, creating study playlists from saved educational content, automating content moderation workflows, and developing tools that help users better organize their YouTube viewing experience. By providing structured API access to Watch Later functionality, this MCP eliminates the need for manual playlist management while enabling sophisticated video curation applications.
