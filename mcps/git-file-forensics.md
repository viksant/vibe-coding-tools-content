# Git File Forensics

Git File Forensics MCP provides advanced file-level analysis capabilities within git repositories, enabling developers to perform detailed forensic investigations on individual files. It tracks complete version histories, analyzes precise diffs between commits, and examines the contextual circumstances surrounding each change. This tool is essential for understanding how specific files evolve over time, identifying when and why changes were introduced, and investigating the impact of modifications across different versions.

The MCP enables semantic change evaluation by going beyond simple line-by-line comparisons to understand the meaningful impact of code modifications. Developers can use it for root cause analysis of bugs, auditing code changes for compliance, and understanding complex refactoring efforts. It's particularly valuable for code reviews, security audits, and maintaining code quality in large codebases where tracking individual file evolution is critical.
