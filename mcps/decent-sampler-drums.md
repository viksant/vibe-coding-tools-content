This MCP helps developers streamline the process of creating professional drum kit configurations for DecentSampler. It does this by analyzing WAV audio samples and generating structured XML-based presets.

The tool smartly processes drum samples, creating velocity-sensitive layers that react to different playing intensities. It also sets up muting groups to manage conflicts between samples, such as open and closed hi-hats. By handling these tasks automatically, it saves users from the tedious work of sample mapping and preset creation, making it easier to prototype and test drum sounds quickly.

Sound designers, music producers, and game audio developers will find this tool especially useful for converting raw drum samples into playable virtual instruments without a hassle.

It can handle batch processing of sample libraries, ensuring consistent mapping across various velocity levels. Plus, it produces DecentSampler-compatible XML files that you can load right into your music production workflow.

This automation speeds up instrument development while keeping the organization of samples and their playback behavior at a professional level.
