# Decent Sampler Drums

This MCP enables developers to automate the creation of professional drum kit configurations for DecentSampler by analyzing WAV audio samples and generating structured XML-based presets. It intelligently processes drum samples to create velocity-sensitive layers that respond to different playing intensities, and establishes muting groups to ensure proper articulation when multiple samples (like open/closed hi-hats) would naturally conflict. This eliminates the tedious manual work of sample mapping and preset creation, allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of drum sounds.

The tool is particularly valuable for sound designers, music producers, and game audio developers who need to quickly convert raw drum samples into playable virtual instruments. It supports batch processing of sample libraries, ensures consistent mapping across different velocity levels, and produces DecentSampler-compatible XML files that can be immediately loaded and used in music production workflows. This automation significantly accelerates instrument development while maintaining professional-grade sample organization and playback behavior.
