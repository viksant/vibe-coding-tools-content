The Framelink Figma MCP Server lets AI coding agents, such as Cursor, tap into Figma design layouts, component structures, and design system details.

This connection helps AI assistants grasp design specifications, pick out UI components, and produce code that aligns with the design requirements.

With this setup, developers can simplify the process of turning designs into code, maintain visual consistency, and automate UI development directly from Figma designs.
