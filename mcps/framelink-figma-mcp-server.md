The Framelink Figma MCP Server provides AI coding agents like Cursor with access to Figma design layouts, component structures, and design system information. 

This enables AI assistants to understand design specifications, extract UI components, and generate code that matches design requirements. 

Developers can streamline the design-to-code workflow, ensure visual consistency, and automate UI development based on Figma designs.
