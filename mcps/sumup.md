The SumUp MCP makes it easy for developers to add payment processing features to their applications using SumUp's detailed API. 

With this tool, developers can tap directly into SumUp's payment infrastructure. This means they can handle transaction processing, manage merchant accounts, and work with various payment methods all in one place. 

Developers also benefit from quick access to SumUp's developer documentation right through the MCP interface. This setup helps keep the development process smooth and minimizes the need to switch back and forth between documentation and coding.

This integration proves especially useful for e-commerce platforms, point-of-sale systems, and any application that needs secure payment processing capabilities.
