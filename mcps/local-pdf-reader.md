# local-pdf-reader

The local-pdf-reader MCP enables developers to programmatically access and extract text content from PDF files stored on their local systems. This tool provides a simple interface for reading PDF documents, parsing their textual content, and making it available for various downstream applications. It handles common PDF formats and can extract structured text while preserving document layout and formatting where possible.

This MCP is particularly valuable for document processing pipelines, data extraction workflows, and content analysis applications. Developers can use it to build automated systems that process invoices, reports, research papers, or any PDF-based documentation. The extracted text can then be fed into search engines, AI models, databases, or other systems for further analysis and processing, eliminating the need for manual PDF content extraction.
