This MCP streamlines the process of migrating notes from Supernotes to Obsidian by automating the import of Supernotes exports into Obsidian's daily notes structure. 

It handles content formatting conversion and automatically generates wikilinks to maintain connections between notes, ensuring your knowledge base remains intact during the transition. The tool preserves your note hierarchy and metadata while adapting the content structure to fit Obsidian's Markdown-based system.

Developers and knowledge workers can use this MCP to maintain a consistent workflow when switching from Supernotes to Obsidian, eliminating manual copy-pasting and formatting headaches. 

It's particularly valuable for teams migrating collaborative knowledge bases or individuals with extensive note collections who want to leverage Obsidian's powerful linking and graph features without losing their existing content relationships. 

The automation ensures daily note imports happen seamlessly, keeping your Obsidian vault synchronized with your Supernotes exports.
