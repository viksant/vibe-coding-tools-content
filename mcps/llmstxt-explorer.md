# LLMs.txt Explorer

The LLMs.txt Explorer MCP enables developers to programmatically discover and utilize website-specific AI instructions defined in llms.txt files. This protocol provides structured guidance for language models interacting with web content, similar to how robots.txt governs web crawler behavior. By fetching and parsing these configuration files, developers can build applications that respect site-specific AI interaction policies and optimize LLM behavior for particular web environments.

This MCP is particularly valuable for building web scraping tools, AI-powered browsers, and automated content interaction systems that need to comply with website owner preferences. It enables context-aware interactions by providing explicit instructions about how language models should engage with specific sites, including content usage guidelines, interaction boundaries, and preferred communication protocols. Developers can create more ethical and effective web AI applications that align with website policies while delivering enhanced user experiences.
