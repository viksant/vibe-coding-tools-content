# LinkedIn MCP Assistant

LinkedIn MCP Assistant (LiGo MCP) is the first Claude and ChatGPT integration specifically designed for LinkedIn creators. It provides AI assistants with access to your LinkedIn post history, enabling content analysis, voice matching, and direct publishing/scheduling functionality. The system analyzes what content performs well, writes in your authentic voice, and allows for seamless content creation and scheduling directly from chat interfaces. This eliminates the need for prompt engineering and streamlines the content creation process for LinkedIn professionals.
