# WeatherXM Pro MCP Server

The WeatherXM Pro MCP Server provides developers with programmatic access to WeatherXM's professional weather data APIs through the Model Context Protocol. This enables AI assistants and development tools to retrieve real-time weather observations, historical data, and accurate forecasts from WeatherXM's global network of weather stations. Developers can integrate precise meteorological data into their applications, build weather-aware AI features, and create context-aware systems that respond to environmental conditions. The server handles authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization, making weather data accessible through standardized MCP tool calls.
