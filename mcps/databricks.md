# Databricks

The Databricks MCP provides seamless integration with Databricks' powerful data platform, allowing developers to execute SQL queries, list database schemas, and inspect table structures directly through the Statement Execution API. This enables comprehensive data exploration and analysis workflows without leaving your development environment.

Developers can leverage this MCP to accelerate data-driven applications by programmatically querying Delta Lake tables, analyzing dataset schemas, and understanding data relationships. It's particularly valuable for building ETL pipelines, generating data quality reports, and supporting analytics applications that require real-time access to Databricks data assets.
