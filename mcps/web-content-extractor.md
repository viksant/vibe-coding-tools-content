# Web Content Extractor

The Web Content Extractor MCP provides developers with powerful tools for extracting, processing, and transforming web content programmatically. Built on TypeScript with Cheerio for DOM parsing and Turndown for HTML-to-Markdown conversion, this MCP enables reliable web scraping operations that can handle complex page structures while maintaining data integrity. It's particularly valuable for content aggregation, data mining, and automated information processing workflows.

This MCP supports various use cases including content summarization, data extraction for machine learning pipelines, website monitoring, and content migration between formats. Developers can leverage it to build applications that require structured data from web sources, automate content processing tasks, and transform HTML content into more usable formats like Markdown for documentation or database storage. The combination of Cheerio's jQuery-like syntax and Turndown's conversion capabilities makes it ideal for projects requiring both content extraction and format transformation.
