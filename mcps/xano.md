# Xano

This MCP provides seamless integration with Xano's powerful no-code backend platform, enabling developers to perform comprehensive data operations through a unified interface. It supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, complex querying, and real-time data manipulation, making it ideal for rapid application development and prototyping workflows. Developers can efficiently manage database records, filter data with advanced conditions, and handle relationships between tables without writing backend code.

The integration significantly accelerates development cycles by eliminating the need for custom backend development while maintaining robust data management capabilities. It's particularly valuable for prototyping MVPs, building internal tools, and creating data-driven applications where speed and flexibility are paramount. Teams can focus on frontend development and user experience while leveraging Xano's scalable infrastructure for their data layer needs.
