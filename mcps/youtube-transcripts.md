# YouTube Transcripts

This MCP provides developers with powerful tools to programmatically extract transcripts, captions, and subtitles from YouTube videos across multiple languages. It enables automated content analysis, translation workflows, and accessibility enhancements by giving structured access to video text content that would otherwise require manual extraction.

Developers can use this MCP to build applications for content summarization, multilingual analysis, educational tools, and accessibility features. It supports extracting both auto-generated and manually uploaded subtitles, making it valuable for content creators, researchers, and developers building video intelligence applications that require reliable text extraction from YouTube's vast video library.
