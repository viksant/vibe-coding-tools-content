# UseScraper

The UseScraper MCP provides developers with a powerful interface to the UseScraper API, enabling efficient web scraping operations with enterprise-grade features. This tool supports extracting web content in multiple formats including HTML, JSON, and structured data, while offering advanced proxy rotation to avoid IP blocking and maintain scraping reliability. Developers can configure custom extraction rules, handle JavaScript-rendered content, and implement rate limiting for ethical scraping practices.

This MCP is particularly valuable for building data pipelines, competitive intelligence tools, and content aggregation systems. It simplifies complex scraping tasks by handling authentication, CAPTCHAs, and session management automatically. The integration supports both static and dynamic content extraction, making it suitable for scraping modern web applications, e-commerce sites, and news platforms while ensuring data quality and compliance with website terms of service.
