# Adobe Commerce Dev MCP

Adobe Commerce Dev MCP Server provides a standardized interface for interacting with Adobe Commerce's extensive API ecosystem and development tools. This MCP implementation enables AI assistants to seamlessly access and manipulate Adobe Commerce resources, including product catalogs, order management, customer data, and store configuration. Developers can leverage AI capabilities to automate common commerce operations, generate code for custom extensions, and troubleshoot platform-specific issues.

The integration streamlines e-commerce development by providing contextual awareness of Adobe Commerce's architecture and capabilities. It supports various development workflows including theme customization, module development, API integration, and performance optimization. This reduces the learning curve for new developers and accelerates development cycles by providing intelligent guidance and automation for common commerce development tasks.
