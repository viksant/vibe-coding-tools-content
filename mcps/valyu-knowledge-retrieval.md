This MCP connects smoothly with Valyu's knowledge retrieval platform, allowing developers to create smart search features that tap into both their own data and online content.

With the API, developers can dive into complex queries across information repositories, getting back results that include important contextual details. They can add advanced search capabilities like semantic matching, filter results by source type, and score relevance to improve user experience.

The feedback submission API plays a key role in refining search outcomes. By gathering user interactions and relevance ratings, it fosters a cycle where user input sharpens the retrieval models, resulting in more accurate and helpful results over time.

You can use this to build intelligent chatbots, enterprise search tools, research assistants, and customer support systems that need to access both internal databases and information from the web.
