# Valyu Knowledge Retrieval

This MCP provides seamless integration with Valyu's knowledge retrieval platform, enabling developers to build intelligent search capabilities across both proprietary data sources and web content. The API allows for sophisticated querying of information repositories, returning relevant results with contextual metadata. Developers can implement advanced search features like semantic matching, filtering by source type, and relevance scoring in their applications.

The feedback submission API enables continuous improvement of search results by collecting user interactions and relevance assessments. This creates a virtuous cycle where user feedback enhances the underlying retrieval models, leading to more accurate and useful results over time. Use cases include building intelligent chatbots, enterprise search tools, research assistants, and customer support systems that require access to both internal knowledge bases and external web information.
