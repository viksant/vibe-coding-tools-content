This MCP server provides a foundational implementation for testing the Model Context Protocol framework and developing custom MCP integrations. It serves as a sandbox environment where developers can experiment with MCP concepts, validate server configurations, and build proof-of-concept implementations before moving to production systems.

The test MCP enables developers to understand MCP's core mechanics, including tool definitions, resource handling, and protocol communication patterns. 

It's particularly valuable for learning the MCP specification, debugging integration issues, and creating reproducible test scenarios for more complex MCP implementations.
