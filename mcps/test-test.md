This MCP server acts as a starting point for testing the Model Context Protocol framework and creating custom MCP integrations. Think of it as a sandbox where developers can try out MCP concepts, check server settings, and develop proof-of-concept projects before launching them in a production environment.

With this test MCP, developers can dive into the core mechanics of MCP. They can explore tool definitions, manage resources, and understand how protocol communication works.

This setup is especially useful for learning the MCP specification, troubleshooting integration problems, and setting up repeatable test scenarios for more intricate MCP implementations.
