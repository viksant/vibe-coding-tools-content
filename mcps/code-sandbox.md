The Code Sandbox MCP creates a safe space for running code in various programming languages. It keeps everything secure by enforcing strict limits on resources and controlling network access.

This setup allows developers to run untrusted code without worries. Whether testing third-party libraries or executing scripts from users, the sandbox ensures that system security stays intact. It blocks unauthorized access to the host resources, reducing the risk of any harmful code causing damage.

There are several benefits to using this sandbox. Developers can safely test code snippets, check user-generated content, and run automated evaluations in educational settings or assessments.

You can find many use cases for the MCP. It works great for online coding interviews, programming challenge websites, and CI/CD pipelines that need to handle untrusted code. Plus, its support for multiple languages makes it adaptable for diverse development workflows while keeping security policies consistent across different programming environments.
