The Code Sandbox MCP provides a secure, isolated environment for executing code across multiple programming languages while enforcing strict resource constraints and network access controls. 

This enables developers to safely run untrusted code, test third-party libraries, or execute user-submitted scripts without compromising system security. The sandbox environment prevents unauthorized access to host resources and limits potential damage from malicious code.

Key benefits include the ability to safely test code snippets, validate user-generated content, and run automated code evaluations in educational or assessment platforms. 

Use cases range from online coding interview platforms and programming challenge websites to CI/CD pipelines that need to execute untrusted code. The MCP's multi-language support makes it versatile for polyglot development workflows while maintaining consistent security policies across different programming environments.
