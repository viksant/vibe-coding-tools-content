# Barnsworthburning Search

This MCP server provides a direct integration with the barnsworthburning.net API, enabling developers and designers to programmatically search and retrieve specialized content on design principles, typography best practices, and user experience (UX) insights. You can query articles, tutorials, and resources without leaving your development environment, streamlining research and information gathering for design-related projects.

The integration is particularly valuable for teams building design systems, creating content-rich applications, or needing quick access to authoritative design knowledge. It supports use cases like automating design documentation lookup, enriching design tools with external knowledge, and embedding typography references directly into development workflows, ultimately improving efficiency and design consistency across projects.
