Unichat MCP offers a TypeScript interface that simplifies how developers work with different AI providers. With this setup, you can interact with various language models through one consistent API. 

This approach saves you from the hassle of learning and implementing separate SDKs for each provider. Youâ€™ll find that it cuts down on integration complexity and speeds up your development process.

Switching between models becomes a breeze. You can compare outputs and set up fallback strategies without needing to tweak your application code. This flexibility is especially useful for creating AI applications that need to stay reliable and available. Plus, it helps you choose the best provider for your needs or tap into specialized features from different models.

The MCP supports platforms like OpenAI, MistralAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google AI. This makes it perfect for applications that want to harness the unique strengths of multiple AI providers at once.
