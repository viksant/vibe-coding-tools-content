# Hoverfly

Hoverfly MCP Server transforms Hoverfly into an AI-driven HTTP mocking solution that enables developers to create, validate, and manage mock APIs on demand through the Model Context Protocol. It supports simulating flaky or third-party services, providing matcher suggestions, templating assistance, log debugging, and live inspection capabilities. Developers can use natural language or structured tools to generate realistic mock responses, test error scenarios, and validate API contracts without manual configuration. This tool is essential for testing resilience, accelerating development cycles, and ensuring reliable integrations with external services.
