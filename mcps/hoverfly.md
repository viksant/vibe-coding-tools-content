Hoverfly MCP Server turns Hoverfly into a smart HTTP mocking solution. With this tool, developers can easily create, validate, and manage mock APIs whenever they need them, all through the Model Context Protocol.

It offers features to simulate unreliable or third-party services. Youâ€™ll find helpful matcher suggestions, templating support, log debugging, and even live inspection capabilities.

Developers can generate realistic mock responses using natural language or structured tools. This allows for testing error scenarios and validating API contracts without needing to set everything up manually.

This tool plays a vital role in testing resilience, speeding up development cycles, and ensuring smooth connections with external services.
