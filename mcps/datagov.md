# Data.gov

This MCP provides seamless integration with Data.gov, enabling developers to programmatically search, retrieve, and access thousands of U.S. government datasets. You can query datasets by keywords, agencies, or categories, and fetch detailed metadata, download links, and structured data formats for immediate use in your applications. This eliminates manual browsing and enables automated data pipeline creation.

The integration supports data-driven analysis, research projects, and application development by providing reliable access to authoritative government data. Use cases include building dashboards with public health statistics, analyzing economic indicators, creating educational tools with scientific data, or developing civic tech applications that leverage open government data for public benefit.
