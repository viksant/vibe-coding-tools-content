# Noves MCP Server

The Noves MCP Server bridges the gap between complex blockchain data and natural language understanding. It provides AI assistants with the ability to query, analyze, and explain blockchain transactions in human-readable formats. This allows developers to quickly understand transaction flows, identify patterns, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights without needing deep blockchain expertise. The server transforms raw blockchain data into actionable intelligence through conversational interfaces.
