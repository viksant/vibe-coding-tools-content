The Noves MCP Server makes it easier to connect with complex blockchain data using natural language. 

It empowers AI assistants to query, analyze, and explain blockchain transactions in a way that’s easy to understand. This helps developers get a clear picture of transaction flows, spot patterns, troubleshoot issues, and gather insights—all without needing to be blockchain experts. 

By turning raw blockchain data into usable information, the server creates a more conversational experience.
