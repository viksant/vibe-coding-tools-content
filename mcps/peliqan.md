# Peliqan

The Peliqan MCP server provides a unified interface to access data from over 250 business applications and databases including Salesforce, HubSpot, NetSuite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Snowflake. It enables developers to query data, perform ETL operations, and run analytical questions across all connected data sources through a single MCP integration. This eliminates the need for multiple individual API connections and simplifies data access across your entire tech stack.

With built-in data warehouse capabilities, Peliqan MCP allows real-time access to internal company data from SaaS applications, CRMs, ERPs, and databases. Developers can use this MCP to build applications that require consolidated data views, automate data workflows, or create custom analytics dashboards. The platform handles authentication, data transformation, and API management, letting developers focus on building data-driven features rather than infrastructure complexity.
