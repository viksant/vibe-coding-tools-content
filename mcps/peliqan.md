The Peliqan MCP server makes it easy to access data from more than 250 business applications and databases, like Salesforce, HubSpot, NetSuite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Snowflake. 

This tool empowers developers to query data, carry out ETL operations, and answer analytical questions across all connected data sources using just one MCP integration. This means no more juggling multiple API connections, which simplifies data access across your entire tech stack.

With its built-in data warehouse capabilities, Peliqan MCP ensures real-time access to your company's internal data from SaaS applications, CRMs, ERPs, and databases.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create applications that need consolidated data views, automate data workflows, or design custom analytics dashboards.

The platform takes care of authentication, data transformation, and API management. This way, developers can focus on creating data-driven features without getting bogged down by infrastructure challenges.
