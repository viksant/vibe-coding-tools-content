# RunPod

This MCP server provides seamless management of RunPod cloud resources directly through MCP-compatible clients like Claude or AI-enhanced IDEs. Developers can create, list, update, and delete pods, serverless endpoints, templates, network volumes, and container registry settings using intuitive natural language commands. It simplifies cloud infrastructure operations by automating complex tasks, reducing manual intervention, and accelerating development cycles with scalable, on-demand compute resources.
