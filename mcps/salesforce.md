The Salesforce MCP server makes it easy to interact with Salesforce orgs using natural language. With this feature, users can ask questions, manage records, and configure platform components just by talking. This approach cuts out the need for complicated SOQL queries or getting lost in Setup menus. It opens the door for business users while boosting productivity for developers.

Developers and administrators can take advantage of this MCP to automate everyday tasks. Whether it's creating custom objects and fields, building flows, managing user permissions, or gaining insights from data, it streamlines the process.

The protocol covers both data operations (CRUD) and metadata operations. This means you get a complete interface for managing the Salesforce platform without needing to be an expert in the technical details of the APIs.
