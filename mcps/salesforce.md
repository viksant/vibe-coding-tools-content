# Salesforce

The Salesforce MCP server enables natural language interaction with Salesforce orgs, allowing users to query data, manage records, and configure platform components through conversational commands. This eliminates the need for complex SOQL queries or manual navigation in Setup menus, making Salesforce more accessible to business users while boosting developer productivity.

Developers and administrators can use this MCP to automate common tasks like creating custom objects and fields, building flows, managing user permissions, and generating insights from data. The protocol supports both data operations (CRUD) and metadata operations, providing a comprehensive interface for Salesforce platform management without requiring deep technical knowledge of the underlying APIs.
