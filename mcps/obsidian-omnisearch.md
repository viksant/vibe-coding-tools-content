# Obsidian Omnisearch

This MCP server provides seamless integration with Obsidian vaults, enabling powerful search and retrieval capabilities across personal knowledge bases. It allows AI assistants to access and query your notes, documents, and research materials stored in Obsidian, transforming your vault into an intelligent knowledge resource that can be leveraged for content creation, research assistance, and information retrieval tasks.

The integration supports advanced search functionality including full-text search, metadata filtering, and contextual retrieval, making it ideal for developers building AI-powered applications that need to incorporate personal or organizational knowledge. Use cases include automated research assistants, content generation tools that reference existing notes, and knowledge management systems that can intelligently surface relevant information from your Obsidian vault based on context and query parameters.
