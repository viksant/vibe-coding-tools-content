Sequa.AI MCP makes it easy for AI development tools like Copilot and Cursor to understand your entire codebase and documentation without any fuss. 

This server works around the clock, indexing and pulling context from all your project files, dependencies, and documents. This setup allows AI assistants to provide better suggestions, refactor code smartly, and answer questions that relate specifically to your code structure.

With MCP, developers no longer need to spend time manually copying and pasting context or dealing with limited context windows. This change boosts the effectiveness of AI assistants significantly.

This feature shines especially in larger codebases, where traditional context limits can hold back AI performance. With MCP, you can expect improved code generation, debugging, and documentation help throughout your projects.
