# Sequa.AI

Sequa.AI MCP automatically gives AI development tools like Copilot and Cursor complete awareness of your entire codebase and documentation without manual configuration. This server continuously indexes and provides context from all project files, dependencies, and docs, enabling AI assistants to make more accurate suggestions, refactor code intelligently, and answer questions based on your specific codebase structure.

The MCP eliminates the need for developers to manually copy-paste context or configure limited context windows, dramatically improving AI assistant effectiveness. It's particularly valuable for large codebases where traditional context limitations hinder AI performance, enabling better code generation, debugging, and documentation assistance across entire projects.
