# Playwright MCP

The Playwright MCP server enables LLMs to automate web browsers and interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots. Instead of relying on screenshots or vision models, this approach provides clean, semantic representations of web content that are easily parseable by language models. This makes web automation more reliable and efficient for tasks like data extraction, form filling, and UI testing.

Developers can leverage this MCP for automated testing, web scraping, and building AI agents that need to interact with web applications. The accessibility-first approach ensures compatibility with modern web standards while providing detailed information about page structure, elements, and their properties. This is particularly valuable for creating reliable automation workflows that work across different browsers and handle dynamic content effectively.
