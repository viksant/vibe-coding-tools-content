The Playwright MCP server lets large language models (LLMs) automate web browsers and engage with web pages using structured accessibility snapshots. Instead of depending on screenshots or visual models, this method offers clear, semantic representations of web content. These representations are easy for language models to understand, which boosts reliability and performance for tasks like data extraction, form filling, and UI testing.

Developers can take advantage of this MCP for automated testing, web scraping, and creating AI agents that interact with web applications. By focusing on accessibility, this approach aligns with modern web standards and delivers detailed insights about page structure, elements, and their properties. This focus proves especially useful for crafting dependable automation workflows that function smoothly across various browsers while effectively handling dynamic content.
