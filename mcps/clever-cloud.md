# Clever Cloud

This MCP provides seamless integration with Clever Cloud's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings, enabling developers to automate application deployment workflows and manage cloud environments programmatically. It supports deploying applications from various sources, configuring environment variables, scaling resources dynamically, and managing add-ons like databases and caches.

Developers can monitor application performance, track resource usage, and receive deployment status updates through the MCP interface. This simplifies cloud operations for teams building web applications, APIs, and microservices, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent deployment processes across development, staging, and production environments.
