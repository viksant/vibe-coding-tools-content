This MCP connects smoothly with Clever Cloud's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offerings. It allows developers to automate how they deploy applications and manage cloud environments through code.

You can deploy applications from different sources, set up environment variables, adjust resources on the fly, and manage add-ons like databases and caches. 

With the MCP interface, developers can keep an eye on application performance, monitor resource usage, and get updates on deployment status. This makes cloud operations easier for teams working on web applications, APIs, and microservices. It cuts down on manual tasks and ensures that deployment processes remain consistent across development, staging, and production environments.
