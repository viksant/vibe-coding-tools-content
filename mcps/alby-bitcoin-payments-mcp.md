# Alby Bitcoin Payments MCP

The Alby Bitcoin Payments MCP enables developers to integrate Bitcoin Lightning Network payments into their AI applications using Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC). This server provides comprehensive support for NWC protocols, LNURL standards, and L402 authentication through the Alby SDK and Lightning Tools. Developers can implement microtransactions, pay-per-use AI services, and blockchain-based monetization directly within their LLM workflows, either by connecting to a remote server or running client-side implementations.

This MCP simplifies cryptocurrency integration by handling wallet connections, payment verification, and transaction management automatically. It's ideal for building AI applications that require decentralized payment systems, content monetization, or blockchain-interactive features without deep expertise in Bitcoin protocols.
