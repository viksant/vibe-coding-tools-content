The Alby Bitcoin Payments MCP makes it easy for developers to add Bitcoin Lightning Network payments to their AI applications using Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC). 

This server supports NWC protocols, LNURL standards, and L402 authentication through the Alby SDK and Lightning Tools. With this setup, developers can create microtransactions, offer pay-per-use AI services, and enable blockchain-based monetization right within their LLM workflows. They can choose to connect to a remote server or run things on the client side.

The MCP takes the hassle out of integrating cryptocurrency by automatically managing wallet connections, payment verification, and transaction handling. 

This solution is perfect for building AI applications that need decentralized payment systems, content monetization, or blockchain features, even if youâ€™re not an expert in Bitcoin protocols.
