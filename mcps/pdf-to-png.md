# PDF to PNG

This MCP server provides seamless PDF to PNG conversion capabilities by integrating with the pdf2image library. It enables developers to programmatically convert entire PDF documents or specific pages into high-quality PNG images, making PDF content easily accessible for image processing, display in web applications, or integration with computer vision workflows. The server handles various PDF formats and resolution settings, ensuring consistent output quality across different document types.

Developers can use this MCP to build applications that require visual representation of PDF content, such as document preview systems, digital asset management tools, or automated reporting pipelines. By converting PDFs to PNG format, content becomes compatible with image manipulation libraries, web browsers, and mobile applications that may not natively support PDF rendering. This simplifies complex document processing tasks and enables richer user experiences with visual document interactions.
