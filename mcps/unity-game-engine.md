This MCP server bridges the Unity Editor with AI model clients, allowing developers to interact with their Unity projects through natural language commands. 

It enables AI assistants to read project files, inspect scene hierarchies, modify game objects, and execute Unity Editor operations programmatically. This integration streamlines game development by automating repetitive tasks, generating code snippets, and providing intelligent suggestions based on project context.

Developers can use this MCP to accelerate prototyping, debug complex scenes, and manage assets more efficiently. 

The server supports real-time collaboration between human developers and AI assistants, making it ideal for rapid iteration, code generation, and automated testing workflows. 

It transforms Unity development by bringing AI-powered intelligence directly into the game creation process.
