Deebo is an autonomous debugging system designed to enhance AI coding agents like Claude, Cline, and Cursor through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). 

It introduces parallel debugging capabilities by running structured investigations in separate Git branches, allowing multiple hypotheses to be tested simultaneously. This approach transforms single-threaded AI development workflows into multi-threaded processes, significantly accelerating debugging cycles.

By creating isolated branches for each investigation, Deebo enables systematic testing of potential fixes without disrupting the main development line. 

It automatically validates solutions, gathers evidence, and provides comprehensive debugging insights. This is particularly valuable for complex codebases where traditional debugging can be time-consuming, allowing developers to maintain momentum while ensuring code quality through rigorous parallel testing methodologies.
