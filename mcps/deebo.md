Deebo is an autonomous debugging tool that boosts the performance of AI coding agents like Claude, Cline, and Cursor using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). 

Here's how it works: Deebo introduces parallel debugging. It runs structured investigations in separate Git branches, which means you can test multiple hypotheses at the same time. This method turns what used to be a single-threaded AI development workflow into a multi-threaded process, speeding up the debugging cycle considerably.

By creating isolated branches for each investigation, Deebo lets developers test potential fixes methodically, all without interrupting the main development line. 

It doesnâ€™t stop there. Deebo automatically checks solutions, collects evidence, and delivers detailed insights into the debugging process. This feature is especially helpful for complex codebases, where traditional debugging can take a lot of time. With Deebo, developers can keep moving forward while ensuring the code maintains high quality through thorough parallel testing methods.
