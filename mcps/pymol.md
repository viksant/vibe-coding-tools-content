# PyMOL

This MCP provides seamless integration with PyMOL, the industry-standard molecular visualization software, allowing researchers and developers to perform complex structural biology tasks through natural language instructions. Users can manipulate protein structures, analyze molecular interactions, create custom visualizations, and generate publication-quality renderings without writing traditional PyMOL scripting commands. The bridge enables intuitive exploration of 3D molecular data, making advanced structural biology accessible to non-experts while accelerating workflows for experienced researchers.

Key capabilities include interactive structure manipulation, measurement of molecular distances and angles, surface and electrostatic potential visualization, animation creation, and high-resolution image export. This empowers drug discovery researchers, structural biologists, and bioinformaticians to rapidly prototype visualizations, conduct structural analysis, and create compelling scientific figures through conversational interfaces. The integration significantly reduces the learning curve for PyMOL's powerful features while maintaining full access to its advanced molecular graphics capabilities.
