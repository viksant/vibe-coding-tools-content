# Prompt Manager

The Prompt Manager MCP provides a centralized system for creating, organizing, and serving reusable prompt templates with dynamic variable substitution. Developers can define templates with placeholders that get replaced with actual values at runtime, ensuring consistency across LLM interactions while maintaining flexibility. The system supports tag-based categorization, making it easy to organize prompts by use case, project, or complexity level.

This tool significantly streamlines development workflows by eliminating repetitive prompt writing and ensuring best practices are consistently applied. It's particularly valuable for code review automation, where standardized prompts can be tailored to specific file types or review criteria. Teams can maintain a shared library of vetted prompts, reducing cognitive load while improving the quality and reliability of AI-assisted development tasks.
