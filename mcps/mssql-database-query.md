# MSSQL Database Query

This MCP provides developers with direct SQL query execution capabilities against Microsoft SQL Server databases through a FastMCP-powered server. The Docker containerization ensures consistent, isolated environments that simplify deployment and eliminate configuration conflicts across different development setups. This enables reliable database interactions without complex setup procedures.

Developers can leverage this MCP for real-time data analysis, automated reporting, and database manipulation tasks. It's particularly valuable for building data pipelines, performing ETL operations, and creating applications that require direct database access. The containerized approach ensures security and scalability while maintaining performance for both development and production workloads.
