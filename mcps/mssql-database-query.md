This MCP offers developers a straightforward way to execute SQL queries directly on Microsoft SQL Server databases through a FastMCP-powered server.

Using Docker for containerization creates consistent and isolated environments. This approach makes deployment easier and removes configuration issues that can arise in different development settings. As a result, developers can interact with databases reliably without facing complex setup challenges.

With this MCP, developers can dive into real-time data analysis, automate reporting, and handle various database tasks. It shines when building data pipelines, conducting ETL operations, and developing applications that need direct access to databases.

The containerized method also boosts security and scalability, all while ensuring strong performance whether in development or production environments.
