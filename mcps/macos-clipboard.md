This MCP provides seamless integration with the MacOS system clipboard, enabling developers to programmatically read from and write to the clipboard for various text processing and data transfer workflows. 

It allows applications to capture clipboard contents for analysis, transformation, or storage, and to populate the clipboard with processed results or structured data.

Developers can leverage this integration to build powerful automation tools, data pipelines, and productivity applications that bridge between different software systems. 

Use cases include text normalization utilities, code snippet managers, cross-application data sharing workflows, and clipboard history tools that enhance developer productivity by streamlining repetitive copy-paste operations.
