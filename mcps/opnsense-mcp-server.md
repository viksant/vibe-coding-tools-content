This MCP server provides a natural language interface for managing OPNsense firewall configurations, allowing developers to interact with their firewall through AI clients. 

Users can create rules, modify settings, and monitor firewall activity using conversational commands instead of manual configuration. 

This streamlines network security management and makes firewall administration more accessible to developers who may not be networking experts.
