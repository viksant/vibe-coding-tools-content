This MCP server offers an easy-to-use language interface for managing OPNsense firewall settings. It lets developers communicate with their firewall using AI clients, making the process much more intuitive.

You can create rules, change settings, and keep an eye on firewall activity with simple conversational commands, rather than going through tedious manual configurations. 

This approach simplifies network security management and opens up firewall administration to developers who might not have a background in networking.
