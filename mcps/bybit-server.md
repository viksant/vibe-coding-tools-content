The Bybit Server MCP makes it easy for developers to connect with the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange using its REST API.

This server gives you quick access to real-time market data, account details, and trading features. With it, you can create advanced trading bots, manage your portfolio, and build applications for market analysis.

You can pull live price feeds, check order books, keep an eye on your positions, and execute trades across a range of cryptocurrency pairs supported by Bybit.

The integration offers both public endpoints for market data and authenticated endpoints for operations tied to your account. Just remember, youâ€™ll need API keys for trading and managing your account.

Developers can use this MCP to automate trading strategies, set up risk management systems, and design custom dashboards to track cryptocurrency markets.

The server also handles errors gracefully and is aware of rate limits, ensuring smooth operation within Bybit's API guidelines. This makes it a great option for both development and live trading environments.
