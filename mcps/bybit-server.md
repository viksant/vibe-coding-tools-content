# Bybit Server

The Bybit Server MCP enables developers to programmatically interact with the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange through its comprehensive REST API. This server provides seamless access to real-time market data, account information, and trading functionalities, allowing you to build sophisticated trading bots, portfolio management tools, and market analysis applications. With this MCP, you can fetch live price feeds, check order books, monitor positions, and execute trades across various cryptocurrency pairs supported by Bybit.

The integration supports both public endpoints for market data and authenticated endpoints for account-specific operations, requiring API keys for trading and account management features. Developers can leverage this MCP to automate trading strategies, implement risk management systems, and create custom dashboards for monitoring cryptocurrency markets. The server includes proper error handling and rate limiting awareness to ensure reliable operation within Bybit's API constraints, making it suitable for both development and production trading environments.
