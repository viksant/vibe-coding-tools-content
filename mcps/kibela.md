This MCP connects smoothly with Kibela's API, allowing developers to easily search, retrieve, and manage team documentation right within their applications.

It offers full-text search capabilities across knowledge bases, helping you find specific notes or articles quickly. Plus, it provides real-time access to your organizationâ€™s knowledge, which means your team can develop smart workflows that tap into documented expertise, automate content retrieval, and keep everyone updated with the latest information.

With this integration, developers can create AI-assisted tools that pull from internal documentation, build knowledge management dashboards, or streamline documentation tasks.

This MCP is a game changer for teams wanting to boost their AI agents with relevant knowledge, simplify information discovery, and ensure they have a single source of truth for all documented processes and decisions.
