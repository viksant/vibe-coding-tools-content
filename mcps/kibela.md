This MCP provides seamless integration with Kibela's API, enabling developers to programmatically search, retrieve, and manage collaborative documentation within their applications. 

It supports full-text search across knowledge bases, fetches specific notes or articles, and facilitates real-time access to organizational knowledge. This empowers teams to build intelligent workflows that leverage documented expertise, automate content retrieval, and maintain up-to-date information access.

Developers can use this integration to create AI-assisted tools that reference internal documentation, build knowledge management dashboards, or automate documentation processes. 

The MCP is particularly valuable for teams looking to enhance their AI agents with contextual knowledge, streamline information discovery, and maintain a single source of truth across their organization's documented processes and decisions.
