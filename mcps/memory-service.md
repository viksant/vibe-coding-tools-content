# Memory Service

The Memory Service MCP provides developers with powerful semantic search and content recommendation capabilities by integrating ChromaDB with sentence transformers. This enables efficient text embedding and similarity search operations, allowing applications to understand and retrieve content based on semantic meaning rather than just keyword matching. Developers can build intelligent features like contextual memory systems, personalized content discovery, and semantic-aware chatbots that maintain conversation context across sessions.

The service operates through websocket connections, providing real-time embedding generation and search capabilities. This makes it ideal for applications requiring immediate semantic analysis, such as live chat systems, dynamic content filtering, or real-time recommendation engines. The combination of ChromaDB's vector database efficiency with advanced transformer models creates a robust foundation for building AI-powered applications that need persistent, semantically-aware memory systems.
