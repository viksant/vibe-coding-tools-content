# Zoom Transcript

This MCP enables seamless integration with Zoom's cloud recording API to automatically retrieve meeting transcripts. Developers can programmatically access transcript data, process the content, and extract key information such as action items, decisions, and important discussion points. The tool supports batch processing of multiple meetings and provides structured data outputs for further analysis.

Use cases include automated meeting summarization, sentiment analysis of discussions, tracking action items across teams, and creating searchable archives of meeting content. This is particularly valuable for project management, compliance documentation, and team productivity tools that need to extract meaningful insights from virtual meetings without manual transcription efforts.
