# CodeAlive

CodeAlive MCP Server bridges AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot, Claude, and Cursor with comprehensive codebase intelligence. It provides semantic search and context enrichment capabilities that enable AI assistants to understand project structure, retrieve relevant code snippets, and maintain better context across large codebases. Developers benefit from more accurate code suggestions, better project comprehension, and streamlined development workflows. The server indexes code repositories and provides intelligent code retrieval through MCP tools, making complex codebase navigation and understanding accessible to AI-powered development environments.
