# Nefino

This MCP provides a direct integration with the Nefino API, enabling developers to programmatically access and filter a comprehensive stream of news and announcements related to renewable energy projects across Germany. It supports complex queries based on project type, location, development stage, and other key criteria, delivering structured data that is essential for accurate market intelligence.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can build applications for automated market analysis, real-time policy change tracking, and environmental impact assessments. It is particularly valuable for energy analysts, investment firms, and sustainability-focused organizations that require timely, reliable data to monitor the rapidly evolving German energy sector, assess investment opportunities, and ensure regulatory compliance.
