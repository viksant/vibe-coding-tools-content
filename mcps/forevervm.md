# ForeverVM

The ForeverVM MCP enables developers to execute long-running Python REPL sessions on remote machines, providing persistent state and continuous execution capabilities. This allows for complex data processing, machine learning model training, and interactive debugging sessions that can span hours or days without losing context or requiring restart.

Developers benefit from uninterrupted workflows where variables, imported modules, and execution state persist across multiple interactions. This is particularly valuable for data scientists working with large datasets, AI researchers training models, and engineers debugging complex systems that require maintaining state over extended periods. The remote execution capability also enables resource-intensive computations to run on powerful servers while developers interact from their local machines.
