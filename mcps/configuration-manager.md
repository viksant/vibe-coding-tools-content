The Configuration Manager MCP provides a centralized interface for managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) client configurations across different platforms and environments. 

It offers developers a consistent way to handle server configurations through operations like retrieval, listing, addition, and removal from client configuration files. This eliminates the need for manual file editing and reduces configuration errors.

By standardizing configuration management, this MCP enables developers to maintain multiple MCP client setups efficiently. It supports scenarios like development, testing, and production environment switching, team configuration sharing, and automated deployment workflows. 

The tool ensures configuration consistency across platforms while providing audit capabilities through configuration listing and retrieval functions.
