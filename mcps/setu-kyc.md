This MCP connects smoothly with Setu's Digital Gateway APIs. It gives developers strong tools for KYC verification, helping them validate identities and meet regulatory standards.

With this integration, you can automate checks for PAN card verification, GST number validation, and use advanced name matching algorithms. This helps you verify both individual and business identities against official government databases.

By tapping into Setu's infrastructure, developers can create secure onboarding processes, manage compliance effectively, and set up fraud prevention systems.

The MCP takes the complexity out of regulatory requirements, turning them into simple API calls. This feature makes it perfect for fintech applications, banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and any service that needs reliable identity verification while ensuring data security and maintaining audit trails.
