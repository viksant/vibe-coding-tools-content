The Perplexity Ask MCP Server integrates Perplexity's web search capabilities into the Model Context Protocol ecosystem. This enables AI assistants to perform real-time web searches, retrieve current information, and access external knowledge without leaving the MCP environment.

Developers can build applications that incorporate up-to-date web content, research capabilities, and information verification through natural language queries.
