This integration allows you to execute buy/sell orders, monitor real-time portfolio performance, and access market data directly through your development environment. 

The MCP facilitates building trading bots, automated investment strategies, and portfolio analysis tools while maintaining secure authentication and transaction handling. 

Developers can create custom trading algorithms, set up automated alerts, and integrate investment management capabilities into their applications.
