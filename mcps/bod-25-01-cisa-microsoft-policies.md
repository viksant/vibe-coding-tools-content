The MCP server connects with the Microsoft Graph API, making it easier to put into action and keep an eye on the security controls outlined in CISA Binding Operational Directive 25-01 within Microsoft 365 environments.

This setup allows security teams to enforce important policies automatically, track compliance status, and create audit reports needed for regulatory purposes.

It also supports automatic fixes for policy violations, ongoing compliance monitoring, and centralized management of security settings. These features help organizations strengthen their security measures, cut down on manual configuration work, and meet federal cybersecurity guidelines through automated processes and immediate policy enforcement.
