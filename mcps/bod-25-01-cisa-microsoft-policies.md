# BOD 25-01 CISA Microsoft Policies

This MCP server provides integration with Microsoft Graph API to automate the implementation and monitoring of CISA Binding Operational Directive 25-01 security controls across Microsoft 365 environments. It enables security teams to programmatically enforce critical security policies, monitor compliance status, and generate audit reports for regulatory requirements.

The tool supports automated remediation of policy violations, continuous compliance monitoring, and centralized management of security configurations. This helps organizations maintain robust security postures, reduce manual configuration efforts, and ensure adherence to federal cybersecurity directives through API-driven automation and real-time policy enforcement.
