# UUID Generator

This MCP provides a robust UUID generation service built on Deno, offering developers a reliable way to create universally unique identifiers for their applications. The tool supports multiple UUID versions (v1, v4, v5) and includes comprehensive logging to track generation events and error handling to ensure consistent operation even under edge cases.

Developers can integrate this service into their workflows to generate unique identifiers for database records, distributed systems, microservices architectures, and any scenario requiring guaranteed uniqueness. The lightweight Deno runtime ensures fast execution and minimal resource overhead, making it suitable for both development and production environments where reliable UUID generation is critical.
