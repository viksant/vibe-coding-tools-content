# Bazel

This MCP provides seamless integration between AI assistants and the Bazel build system, enabling developers to interact with Bazel workspaces programmatically. It supports core Bazel operations including building specific targets, querying dependency graphs, executing tests, and managing workspace configurations. The bridge handles complex build scenarios and provides structured responses for analysis.

A key advantage is its ability to operate reliably even in environments with misconfigured shells or limited terminal access. This makes it ideal for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing systems, and development environments where direct shell interaction is problematic. Developers can automate build verification, dependency analysis, and test execution workflows while maintaining consistent behavior across different execution contexts.
