This MCP connects AI assistants with the Bazel build system, allowing developers to work with Bazel workspaces in a programmatic way.

It covers essential Bazel functions such as building specific targets, querying dependency graphs, running tests, and managing workspace settings. The bridge simplifies complex build scenarios and delivers organized responses for further analysis.

One major benefit is its reliable performance, even in situations with misconfigured shells or limited access to terminals. This feature makes it perfect for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing systems, and development setups where direct shell interaction can be tricky.

With this tool, developers can automate tasks like build verification, dependency analysis, and test execution workflows, all while ensuring consistent behavior across various execution environments.
