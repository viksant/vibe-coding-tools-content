# Zerodha Kite

This MCP provides seamless integration with Zerodha Kite, India's leading trading platform, allowing developers to build sophisticated algorithmic trading systems and comprehensive portfolio management solutions. It exposes the full Kite API functionality including real-time market data streaming, order placement, position tracking, and historical data access through a standardized MCP interface.

Developers can leverage this integration to create automated trading strategies, risk management systems, and portfolio analytics tools tailored for the Indian financial markets. The MCP handles authentication, WebSocket connections, and API rate limiting, making it easier to focus on trading logic rather than platform integration complexities. It's ideal for quantitative analysts, fintech startups, and individual traders looking to automate their investment strategies in Indian equities, derivatives, and mutual funds.
