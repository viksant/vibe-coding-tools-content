This MCP connects smoothly with Zerodha Kite, which is India's top trading platform. It gives developers the tools they need to create advanced algorithmic trading systems and detailed portfolio management solutions.

With this integration, you can access the full range of Kite API features. This includes real-time market data streaming, placing orders, tracking positions, and retrieving historical dataâ€”all through a straightforward MCP interface.

Developers can use this setup to design automated trading strategies, manage risks, and build portfolio analytics tools specifically for the Indian financial markets.

The MCP takes care of authentication, WebSocket connections, and API rate limiting. This means you can concentrate on your trading logic without getting bogged down by the complexities of platform integration.

It's perfect for quantitative analysts, fintech startups, and individual traders who want to automate their investment strategies in Indian equities, derivatives, and mutual funds.
