# Filesystem Access

This Filesystem Access MCP provides developers with direct, programmatic access to local filesystem operations through a FastMCP-powered server. It enables reading file contents and listing directory entries, supporting both stdio and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport modes for flexible integration. The MCP server handles file I/O operations efficiently, making it ideal for tools that need to interact with local file systems programmatically.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build file management utilities, content processing pipelines, and development tools that require filesystem interaction. It's particularly valuable for creating file watchers, build tools, documentation generators, and any application that needs to traverse directories or read file contents. The dual transport support ensures compatibility with various deployment scenarios, from command-line tools to web-based applications requiring real-time file system monitoring.
