# macOS GUI Control

This MCP enables AI assistants to interact with macOS applications by leveraging the macOS accessibility framework to capture screenshots, identify UI elements, and automate mouse and keyboard actions. It provides programmatic control over GUI applications, allowing for automated testing, workflow automation, and accessibility enhancements.

Developers can use this MCP to build AI-powered automation tools that can navigate applications, fill forms, click buttons, and perform complex UI interactions. This is particularly valuable for creating automated testing suites, building accessibility tools for users with disabilities, or developing robotic process automation (RPA) solutions that work with macOS applications.
