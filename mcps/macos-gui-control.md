This MCP lets AI assistants connect with macOS applications by using the macOS accessibility framework. It can capture screenshots, identify user interface elements, and automate mouse and keyboard actions.

With this capability, you gain programmatic control over GUI applications. This opens up possibilities for automated testing, streamlining workflows, and enhancing accessibility.

Developers can tap into this MCP to create automation tools that navigate applications, fill out forms, click buttons, and carry out complex interactions with the user interface.

This functionality proves especially useful for building automated testing suites, developing accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities, or creating robotic process automation (RPA) solutions that work seamlessly with macOS applications.
