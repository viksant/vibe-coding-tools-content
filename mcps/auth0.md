The Auth0 MCP Server gives developers an easy way to manage their Auth0 identity platform right from Cursor, all using simple language.

With this integration, you can create and set up Auth0 applications, tweak client settings, and handle authentication flows without stepping outside your development environment.

You can also automate configuration updates and sync application settings with your codebase. This makes setting up identity management smoother and better integrated into your development workflow.
