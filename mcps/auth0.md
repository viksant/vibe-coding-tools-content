# Auth0

The Auth0 MCP Server enables developers to seamlessly manage their Auth0 identity platform directly within Cursor using natural language. This integration allows you to create and configure Auth0 applications, update client settings, and manage authentication flows without leaving your development environment. You can automate configuration updates, synchronize application settings with your codebase, and streamline your authentication setup process, making identity management more efficient and integrated with your development workflow.
