This MCP server lets you dive into Google Ads transparency data using a strong FastMCP-based setup with three connected services.

First, it gives you access to Google's Ads Transparency API via ScrapeCreators. It also keeps a handy SQLite media cache in `~/.cache/google-ads-mcp/` to boost performance. Plus, it uses Gemini AI for advanced video content analysis.

Youâ€™ll find seven specialized tools available for ad searching, data retrieval, AI-driven media analysis, and managing the cache.

This server supports image analysis with Claude's vision capabilities and video processing through Gemini. It includes thorough error handling and smart caching strategies to reduce unnecessary API calls and maintain a dependable operation.
