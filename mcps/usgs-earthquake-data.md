# USGS Earthquake Data

This MCP provides seamless integration with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake data API, enabling developers to programmatically access real-time and historical seismic event information. It offers robust querying capabilities for filtering earthquakes by magnitude, location, time range, and other geological parameters, making it ideal for building applications that require up-to-date seismic monitoring and analysis.

The integration supports critical use cases across multiple domains, including disaster response systems that need immediate earthquake alerts, geological research platforms analyzing seismic patterns over time, and risk assessment tools for infrastructure planning. By providing structured access to authoritative USGS data, this MCP eliminates the complexity of direct API integration and ensures reliable, standardized earthquake information for applications in public safety, scientific research, and environmental monitoring.
