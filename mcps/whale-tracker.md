Whale Tracker MCP provides real-time monitoring of large-scale cryptocurrency transactions across multiple blockchain networks. It enables developers to track whale movements by offering detailed transaction information including wallet addresses, transaction amounts, timestamps, and blockchain metadata.

The service includes configurable filtering options that allow users to set thresholds for transaction sizes, specific tokens, or target wallets. This makes it ideal for building automated trading alerts, market analysis dashboards, and risk management systems.

This MCP is particularly valuable for traders, analysts, and financial applications that need to monitor significant market movements. By integrating whale transaction data into their applications, developers can create sophisticated trading strategies, detect market manipulation patterns, and provide valuable insights to end-users.

The real-time nature of the data ensures timely responses to market-moving events, while the cross-chain support allows for comprehensive coverage across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
