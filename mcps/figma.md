This MCP serves as a user-friendly interface for the Figma API, making it easy for developers to work with design files, manage comments, and access design assets.

It connects development workflows with design systems, allowing teams to automatically pull design specifications, track versions, and collaborate in real time.

With this MCP, teams can close the gap between design and engineering. They can analyze design components using AI, automatically create design tokens, and streamline feedback loops.

Some practical examples include automating UI testing to match design specs, generating code components directly from Figma designs, and ensuring design system consistency across projects by accessing Figma's extensive design data programmatically.
