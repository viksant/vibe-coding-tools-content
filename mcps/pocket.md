# Pocket

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Pocket API, enabling developers to build applications that can intelligently retrieve and manage saved articles using natural language queries. Instead of traditional keyword-based searches, users can ask questions or describe content in conversational language to find relevant articles from their Pocket reading list.

The integration supports comprehensive article management capabilities including adding new articles, organizing saved items, and retrieving content with rich metadata. This is particularly valuable for building personalized reading assistants, content curation tools, or research applications that need to access and organize web content efficiently. Developers can create smarter reading experiences that understand user intent rather than just matching keywords.
