This MCP acts as the backbone for the entire Chainstack Web3 Developer Portal, hosting all kinds of documentation like guides, API references, and release notes in a structured way. 

With this setup, AI agents and developer tools can tap into a wealth of Web3 knowledge that's been gathered over the years. That means no more waiting for external API calls or searching through documentation manually.

Developers can make the most of this MCP to create smarter Web3 applications. They can directly integrate Chainstack's comprehensive documentation into their workflows. 

This feature allows for real-time access to deployment guides, instructions for running nodes, and API specifications. It's perfect for creating intelligent development assistants, automated deployment processes, and development environments that are well-versed in Web3 infrastructure best practices.
