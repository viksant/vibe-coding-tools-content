This MCP serves the entire Chainstack Web3 Developer Portal as a local instance, streaming all documentation including guides, API references, and release notes as structured MCP resources. 

It provides AI agents and developer tools with immediate access to years of accumulated Web3 knowledge, eliminating the need for external API calls or manual documentation lookups.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build smarter Web3 applications that incorporate Chainstack's extensive documentation directly into their workflows. 

This enables real-time access to deployment guides, node operation instructions, and API specifications, making it ideal for building intelligent development assistants, automated deployment pipelines, and documentation-aware development environments that understand Web3 infrastructure best practices.
