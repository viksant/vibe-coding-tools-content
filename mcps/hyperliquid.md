# Hyperliquid

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Hyperliquid SDK, enabling developers to access comprehensive cryptocurrency market data in real-time. It delivers essential trading information including mid prices, historical candlestick patterns, and detailed L2 order book data with depth information. This allows for sophisticated market analysis and trading strategy development.

The integration supports both real-time streaming data and historical data queries, making it ideal for building trading bots, analytical dashboards, and risk management tools. Developers can monitor market movements, backtest strategies, and implement automated trading systems with reliable, low-latency data feeds from Hyperliquid's decentralized exchange infrastructure.
