# Google Calendar

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Google Calendar API, enabling developers to programmatically manage calendar data within their applications. It supports comprehensive CRUD operations for events and calendars, allowing for automated scheduling, event synchronization, and calendar management workflows. Developers can leverage this integration to build intelligent scheduling assistants, automated meeting planners, and real-time calendar synchronization tools.

The MCP handles authentication, API rate limiting, and error management, simplifying the complexity of direct API interactions. It's ideal for building productivity applications, team coordination tools, and automated scheduling systems that require reliable calendar integration. Use cases include meeting automation, availability checking, event reminders, and cross-platform calendar synchronization across organizational workflows.
