# Random Generation

This MCP server provides comprehensive random generation capabilities for developers building applications that require unpredictable or unique identifiers. It supports generation of UUIDs (v4 and v7), random numbers within specified ranges, customizable strings with character sets, secure passwords with configurable complexity, and various other randomized data types. These utilities are essential for creating secure authentication systems, generating unique database keys, implementing probabilistic algorithms, and testing applications with random data inputs.

The server enables developers to quickly integrate robust randomization features without implementing complex generation logic themselves. Use cases include creating secure session tokens, generating test data for QA environments, building lottery or gaming systems, and implementing cryptographic operations that require high-quality randomness. The MCP ensures cryptographically secure random generation where appropriate, making it suitable for security-sensitive applications.
