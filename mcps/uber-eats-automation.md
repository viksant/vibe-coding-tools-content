# Uber Eats Automation

This MCP provides programmatic control over Uber Eats by automating browser interactions to search menus and place food orders. Developers can build applications that automatically find restaurants, filter menu items based on dietary preferences or price ranges, and complete the ordering process without manual intervention. This enables sophisticated food delivery workflows and integration with other systems.

The automation capabilities support use cases like scheduled meal ordering, bulk ordering for teams, intelligent food recommendations based on historical preferences, and integration with calendar or health tracking apps. By handling the complex browser interactions required for Uber Eats operations, this MCP eliminates the need for manual ordering while providing reliable, repeatable food delivery automation for both personal and enterprise applications.
