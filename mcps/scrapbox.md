# Scrapbox

The Scrapbox MCP server provides seamless integration with Scrapbox's collaborative note-taking platform, allowing developers to programmatically access and retrieve page content, metadata, and project information. This enables automation of knowledge management workflows, such as syncing documentation, generating reports from collaborative notes, or incorporating real-time team knowledge into development processes.

By bridging Scrapbox's intuitive wiki-style interface with developer tools, this MCP empowers teams to maintain living documentation, track project decisions, and leverage collective intelligence directly within their technical workflows. Developers can build applications that dynamically pull information from Scrapbox pages, create content synchronization systems, or implement knowledge-driven automation that responds to updates in collaborative documentation.
