This MCP extension connects Stata statistical software with today’s development environments. This connection lets data scientists and researchers work in the coding tools they prefer.

With this extension, users can run Stata commands and .do files directly, while also viewing output in real time—all without needing to switch between different applications. Plus, the integration with the MCP protocol helps AI assistants understand Stata workflows. This means you get smart code suggestions, error detection, and help with statistical analysis right in your editor.

Developers can take advantage of this extension to boost their productivity in statistical programming, data analysis pipelines, and research tasks.

Thanks to the real-time feedback and AI features, tackling complex statistical operations becomes easier. You can enjoy all of Stata's powerful analysis tools, seamlessly integrated into a modern coding environment.
