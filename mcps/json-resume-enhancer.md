# JSON Resume Enhancer

The JSON Resume Enhancer MCP automatically enriches JSON Resume profiles by analyzing GitHub repositories and intelligently incorporating project details. It fetches existing resume data, scans codebases for technologies used, contributions made, and project significance, then uses OpenAI's API to generate professional descriptions and updates. This saves developers hours of manual work while ensuring their resumes accurately reflect their latest technical achievements and maintain a consistent, professional format.

Developers can use this tool to keep their technical resumes current with minimal effort, showcase their most relevant projects, and highlight specific skills gained from each repository. It's particularly valuable for job seekers, freelancers, and developers maintaining an up-to-date professional portfolio, providing automated insights that might otherwise be overlooked when manually updating resume content.
