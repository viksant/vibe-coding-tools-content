# Confluence

This MCP provides seamless integration with Atlassian Confluence, allowing developers to programmatically access and retrieve content from Confluence pages and blog posts. It enables powerful knowledge base querying capabilities, making it easy to search, filter, and analyze organizational documentation. Developers can extract structured data, metadata, and content from Confluence spaces, supporting use cases like automated documentation analysis, content synchronization, and knowledge management workflows.

The integration supports authentication with Confluence Cloud and Data Center instances, providing flexible access to organizational knowledge repositories. This enables teams to build intelligent applications that leverage existing documentation, create automated reporting systems, and develop AI-powered assistants that can answer questions based on company knowledge bases. The MCP handles pagination, content formatting, and search operations, simplifying complex Confluence API interactions into straightforward developer-friendly interfaces.
