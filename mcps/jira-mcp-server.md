The Jira MCP Server brings the power of Jira's project management tools right into your MCP workflows. This setup lets language models interact smoothly with Jira issues, sprints, and boards.

You can create tickets, check project status, and carry out agile or scrum tasks using simple natural language commands. 

Plus, the server offers easy access to any Jira GET endpoint. This means AI agents can pull in custom data and adjust to different project management needs.

Overall, this integration makes development workflows more efficient by merging Jira's features with AI-assisted coding and planning.
