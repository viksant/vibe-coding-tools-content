# Jira MCP Server

The Jira MCP Server integrates Jira's project management capabilities directly into MCP workflows, enabling language models to interact with Jira issues, sprints, and boards. It supports creating tickets, analyzing project status, and executing agile/scrum operations through natural language commands. The server also provides flexible access to any Jira GET endpoint, allowing AI agents to retrieve custom data and adapt to various project management needs. This streamlines development workflows by bringing Jira functionality into AI-assisted coding and planning environments.
