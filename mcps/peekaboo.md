Peekaboo is a unique MCP server designed specifically for macOS. It allows AI agents to take screenshots of applications or the entire system with ease.

Whatâ€™s cool is that it also offers optional visual question answering features. Whether you use local or remote AI models, these capabilities give agents the visual context they need for tasks like debugging and interacting with applications.

This means goodbye to those frustrating blind debugging moments. Now, agents can visually analyze application states, user interface elements, and system behaviors in real-time, making their work much more effective.
