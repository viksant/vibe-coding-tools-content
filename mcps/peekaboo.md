# Peekaboo

Peekaboo is a macOS-exclusive MCP server that enables AI agents to capture screenshots of applications or the entire system. It provides optional visual question answering capabilities through local or remote AI models, giving AI agents visual context for debugging and interaction tasks. This eliminates blind debugging scenarios and allows agents to visually analyze application states, UI elements, and system behaviors in real-time.
