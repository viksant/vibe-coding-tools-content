# Amazon EKS MCP Server

The Amazon EKS MCP server enables AI assistants to interact directly with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service clusters, providing comprehensive Kubernetes resource management capabilities. Developers can use natural language commands to deploy applications, scale resources, inspect pod statuses, and manage configurations across their EKS environments. This eliminates the need for manual kubectl commands and complex YAML editing, streamlining the container orchestration workflow.

The server offers real-time cluster state visibility, allowing AI assistants to monitor resource utilization, track deployment progress, and identify performance bottlenecks. Troubleshooting capabilities include automated log analysis, resource health checks, and intelligent recommendations for resolving common Kubernetes issues. This empowers development teams to maintain robust, scalable containerized applications with reduced operational overhead and faster incident resolution.
