# Jentic

Jentic MCP revolutionizes API integration by enabling developers to search for capabilities rather than specific vendor implementations. Using the MCP protocol and Jentic's agentic runtime, developers can declaratively describe what they need to accomplish, and the system automatically discovers compatible APIs and workflows. This approach eliminates the need to write and maintain boilerplate integration code for each API.

The platform instantly generates integration code samples that abstract away API-specific details, providing standardized interfaces that work across different providers. This significantly reduces development time, minimizes maintenance overhead, and future-proofs integrations against API changes. Jentic is ideal for building applications that require multiple external service integrations, rapid prototyping, and maintaining complex multi-API systems without vendor lock-in.
