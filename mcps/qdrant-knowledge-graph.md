# Qdrant Knowledge Graph

The Qdrant Knowledge Graph MCP combines the power of knowledge graphs with advanced semantic search capabilities, enabling developers to build sophisticated context-aware applications. This integration allows for efficient storage of structured information as interconnected entities and relationships, while providing lightning-fast semantic search across the entire knowledge base.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create intelligent systems that understand complex relationships between data points and retrieve relevant information based on semantic similarity rather than just keyword matching. This enables use cases like intelligent recommendation engines, advanced question-answering systems, and context-aware chatbots that maintain deep understanding of domain-specific knowledge structures and relationships.
