This MCP offers a complete solution for managing Docker containers using a user-friendly TypeScript interface. Developers can easily control their containerized environments with just a few commands.

You can perform key tasks like listing your existing containers, launching new ones, stopping active containers, cleaning up unused resources, and pulling images from Docker registries. 

This setup makes your container workflows smoother, fitting right into your favorite development tools and automation pipelines. Itâ€™s especially handy for CI/CD systems, local development setups, and infrastructure management, where you need to control containers programmatically.

With the TypeScript interface, you get the benefits of type safety, enhancing the overall developer experience while staying compatible with Docker's main features.
