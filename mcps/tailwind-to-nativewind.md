# Tailwind to NativeWind

This MCP enables developers to automatically transform Tailwind CSS components into NativeWind 4-compatible code for React Native applications. NativeWind brings Tailwind's utility-first CSS methodology to React Native, allowing developers to use familiar Tailwind classes while maintaining native performance. The transformation process handles the conversion of web-specific Tailwind utilities to their React Native equivalents, ensuring consistent styling across platforms.

By bridging the gap between web and mobile development, this tool significantly accelerates React Native development workflows. Developers can reuse existing Tailwind components, maintain design system consistency, and reduce the manual effort required for platform-specific styling adaptations. This is particularly valuable for teams building cross-platform applications who want to leverage their Tailwind expertise while ensuring optimal native performance in React Native environments.
