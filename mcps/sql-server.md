This MCP Server provides seamless integration with Microsoft SQL Server, allowing developers to interact with relational databases using natural language commands. 

It enables comprehensive database schema exploration, direct SQL query execution, and efficient management of stored procedures through JSON-RPC communication. The tool bridges the gap between conversational interfaces and database operations, making complex data analysis accessible without deep SQL expertise.

Developers can leverage this MCP for rapid prototyping, data exploration, and automated database management workflows. 

It supports both ad-hoc querying for data analysis and structured operations for schema modifications and stored procedure development. This significantly accelerates database-related tasks while maintaining the power and flexibility of SQL Server's robust relational database capabilities.
