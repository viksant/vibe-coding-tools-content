The MCP Server connects smoothly with Microsoft SQL Server, letting developers use natural language commands to work with relational databases. 

This tool helps users explore database schemas, execute SQL queries directly, and manage stored procedures efficiently using JSON-RPC communication. By bridging conversational interfaces and database operations, it makes complex data analysis easier for those who may not have extensive SQL knowledge.

Developers can use the MCP for quick prototyping, data exploration, and automating database management tasks. 

It allows for on-the-spot querying for data analysis as well as structured operations for modifying schemas and developing stored procedures. This setup speeds up database tasks while retaining the power and versatility of SQL Server's relational database features.
