This MCP server creates a secure local environment for executing Python code by using Hugging Face's smolagents LocalPythonExecutor. 

It allows developers to run code safely, thanks to built-in safeguards that limit risky operations and control which imports are allowed. This way, it helps prevent common security issues while still giving developers the flexibility they need. Plus, it makes local setup straightforwardâ€”no complicated Docker containers or cloud services involved.

Developers can use this server to test code snippets, run AI-generated code safely, and prototype without putting system security at risk. 

This restricted execution environment works great for educational tools, AI assistants that generate code, and development workflows that prioritize safety. It offers the ease of local execution along with top-notch security measures.
