This MCP server provides a secure local Python execution environment by wrapping Hugging Face's smolagents LocalPythonExecutor. 

It enables safe code execution with built-in safeguards that restrict dangerous operations and limit allowed imports, preventing common security risks while maintaining development flexibility. The solution offers the simplicity of local setup without the complexity of Docker containers or cloud runtimes.

Developers can use this for testing code snippets, running AI-generated code safely, and prototyping without compromising system security. 

The restricted execution environment is ideal for educational tools, AI assistants that generate code, and development workflows where safety is paramount. It combines the convenience of local execution with enterprise-grade security controls.
