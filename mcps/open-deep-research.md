# Open Deep Research

This MCP server provides a bridge between MCP clients and HuggingFace's Open Deep Research project, which is built on their smolagents library. It enables AI assistants and other MCP clients to leverage sophisticated research capabilities including literature review, data analysis, and knowledge synthesis through a standardized interface. The wrapper maintains the full functionality of the original project while making it accessible through the Model Context Protocol.

Developers can integrate advanced research workflows into their applications, allowing AI systems to perform complex research tasks such as academic paper analysis, trend identification, and evidence-based reasoning. This is particularly valuable for research assistants, academic tools, and knowledge management systems that require access to cutting-edge research capabilities without building complex infrastructure from scratch.
