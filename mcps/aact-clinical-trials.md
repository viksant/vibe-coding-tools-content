# AACT Clinical Trials

This MCP provides direct integration with the AACT (Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov) database, enabling developers to programmatically access and analyze comprehensive clinical trials data. Researchers and healthcare professionals can leverage this tool to perform complex queries, extract trial metadata, study outcomes, and participant demographics at scale. The integration supports advanced data analysis workflows for evidence-based research, drug development, and healthcare decision-making.

By offering a structured API interface to AACT's extensive dataset, this MCP eliminates the need for manual data extraction and processing. Developers can build applications that monitor trial status, compare treatment outcomes, identify recruitment trends, and generate real-time insights. This enables faster research cycles, improved clinical study design, and more efficient healthcare analytics pipelines for academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and medical research organizations.
