The Anki Cards MCP (Clanki) enables developers to programmatically interact with Anki, the popular spaced repetition flashcard system. This integration allows you to create, update, and organize flashcards and decks through code, making it ideal for documenting technical concepts, memorizing API endpoints, or studying programming languages.

You can automate card creation from code snippets, error messages, or documentation, ensuring important technical knowledge is systematically reviewed and retained.

By bringing Anki into your development environment, this MCP bridges the gap between learning and coding. Developers can create study materials on-the-fly while working, maintain technical vocabulary decks, or prepare for certifications without context switching.

The automation capabilities significantly reduce the overhead of manual card creation, making spaced repetition practical for busy technical professionals who need to continuously learn and recall complex information.
