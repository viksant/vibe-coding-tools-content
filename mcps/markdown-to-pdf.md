# Markdown to PDF

This MCP server enables developers to programmatically convert Markdown content to PDF documents using Puppeteer's headless Chrome capabilities. It provides robust syntax highlighting for code blocks, custom CSS styling options for branding and layout control, and watermarking features for document security and attribution. The tool is ideal for generating technical documentation, reports, invoices, and any content that requires consistent, professional formatting from Markdown source.

Developers can integrate this conversion capability directly into their applications and workflows, automating document generation pipelines without manual intervention. It supports various output configurations including page size, margins, headers/footers, and custom fonts. Common use cases include automated report generation, documentation systems, content management platforms, and any scenario where Markdown content needs to be distributed as polished PDF files with code syntax highlighting and branding elements.
