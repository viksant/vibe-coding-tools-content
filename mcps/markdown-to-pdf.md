This MCP server gives developers a handy way to turn Markdown content into PDF documents using Puppeteer's headless Chrome features. 

It does a great job with syntax highlighting for code blocks, offers custom CSS styling options for branding and layout, and includes watermarking to keep documents secure and properly attributed. This tool is perfect for creating technical documentation, reports, invoices, or any content that needs to look consistent and professional straight from Markdown.

Developers can easily add this conversion feature to their applications and workflows, allowing them to automate document generation without needing to do it manually.

The server supports various settings, including page size, margins, headers and footers, and custom fonts.

Youâ€™ll find it useful for automated report generation, documentation systems, content management platforms, and any situation where you need to share Markdown content as polished PDF files complete with code syntax highlighting and branding elements.
