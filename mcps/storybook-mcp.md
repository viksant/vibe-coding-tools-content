# Storybook MCP

The Storybook MCP streamlines UI development by automatically creating and linking example stories for each component. This enables developers to visually verify components in their key states, providing immediate feedback on appearance and behavior across different scenarios. The generated stories serve as both documentation and component tests, ensuring UI consistency and reducing manual testing efforts.

By integrating with Storybook's ecosystem, this MCP supports comprehensive component development workflows. It helps teams maintain design system integrity, accelerates development cycles through automated story generation, and improves collaboration between developers and designers. The automated stories provide living documentation that stays in sync with component changes, making it easier to onboard new team members and maintain UI quality at scale.
