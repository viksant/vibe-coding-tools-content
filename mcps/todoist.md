# Todoist

The Todoist MCP provides seamless integration with the Todoist API, allowing AI assistants to directly interact with task management systems. Developers can build intelligent productivity tools that automate task creation, organize projects, set priorities and due dates, and track progress across teams. This enables sophisticated workflow automation where AI can manage to-do lists, coordinate project timelines, and optimize task allocation based on priorities and deadlines.

Use cases include AI-powered personal productivity assistants that automatically schedule tasks, team coordination tools that sync project updates across members, and workflow automation systems that integrate task management with other development tools. The MCP supports natural language task creation, intelligent project organization, and real-time synchronization, making it ideal for developers building productivity-focused applications that require sophisticated task management capabilities.
