# Create Server Scaffold

Create Server Scaffold is a developer tool that simplifies the process of building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers by providing a standardized development framework. It offers a collection of pre-configured templates and a structured protocol that handles common setup tasks like project structure, dependency management, and configuration files. This eliminates the need for manual boilerplate code and ensures consistency across different MCP server implementations.

Developers can quickly bootstrap new MCP servers using the npx-invokable command-line tool, which generates production-ready scaffolds with best practices built-in. This accelerates development cycles, reduces configuration errors, and enables teams to focus on implementing server logic rather than infrastructure setup. The tool is particularly valuable for teams building multiple MCP servers or maintaining standardized architectures across projects.
