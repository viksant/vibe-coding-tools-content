# MyIP

The MyIP MCP integrates with the ifconfig.me API to provide real-time public IP address information, enabling developers to quickly retrieve network configuration data for diagnostic and monitoring purposes. This tool is essential for applications that require IP-based geolocation, network troubleshooting, or security auditing, offering a simple way to access critical network metadata without complex setup.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can build features like automated network health checks, IP-based access controls, and location-aware services. It supports various use cases including VPN detection, server monitoring, and compliance verification, making it invaluable for DevOps, cybersecurity, and web service development workflows.
