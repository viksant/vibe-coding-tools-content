# DBLP

This MCP provides a direct interface to the DBLP computer science bibliography, one of the most comprehensive academic databases for computer science literature. Developers can programmatically search millions of publications across all CS disciplines, retrieve detailed metadata including authors, venues, and abstracts, and generate properly formatted BibTeX entries for citations. The API supports complex queries with filters for authors, conferences, journals, and publication years, making it ideal for building academic tools and research applications.

Beyond basic search functionality, this MCP enables sophisticated research analysis by providing access to citation networks, publication trends, and author collaboration patterns. Developers can build applications that track research impact, analyze emerging fields, monitor institutional productivity, or create personalized recommendation systems. The structured data format ensures consistency for integration with academic writing tools, reference managers, and research dashboards, streamlining the entire literature review and publication workflow.
