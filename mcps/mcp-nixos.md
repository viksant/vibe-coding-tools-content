# mcp-nixos

The mcp-nixos MCP server provides deep integration with the Nix ecosystem, offering real-time access to over 130,000 NixOS packages, 22,000+ configuration options, and extensive system settings. This server enables developers to query package availability, version history, and configuration details directly through their LLM environment, making Nix-based development more efficient and accessible.

Developers can quickly find specific packages, explore configuration options, and understand system settings without leaving their coding environment. The integration with NixHub.io provides commit-level version history, allowing precise package version tracking and dependency management for complex Nix projects.
