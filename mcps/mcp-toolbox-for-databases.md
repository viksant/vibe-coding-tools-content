# MCP Toolbox for Databases

The MCP Toolbox for Databases is an open source MCP server that delivers comprehensive database management capabilities through a unified interface. It enables developers to work seamlessly with both traditional relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cloud SQL) and modern cloud-native systems (BigQuery, Bigtable, Spanner, AlloyDB), plus graph databases like Neo4j and Dgraph. The toolbox provides secure, high-performance operations including query execution, schema management, and data migration across supported platforms.

This MCP server simplifies database development by offering standardized tooling that works across multiple database technologies. Developers can build applications that leverage the best features of each database system while maintaining consistent workflows. The open source nature ensures transparency and community-driven improvements, making it ideal for teams working in polyglot persistence environments or migrating between different database solutions.
