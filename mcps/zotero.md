# Zotero

This MCP provides seamless integration with Zotero, enabling developers and researchers to programmatically access and manage their reference libraries. You can search through academic papers, organize research materials, create and edit notes, and perform advanced library management tasks directly through API calls. This automation streamlines literature reviews, citation management, and collaborative research projects.

The integration supports enhanced research workflows by allowing bulk operations, automated metadata extraction, and synchronization between local libraries and cloud storage. Developers can build custom tools for academic writing, research dashboards, and knowledge management systems that leverage Zotero's robust citation database and organizational capabilities.
