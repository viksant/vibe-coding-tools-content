This MCP server enables AI assistants to interact with MySQL databases in a secure, read-only capacity. Developers can leverage their AI tools to execute SQL queries, inspect database schemas, examine table structures, and analyze data without the risk of accidental modifications. 

The server provides a safe interface for data exploration and investigation, making it ideal for debugging, reporting, and data analysis workflows.

The server supports common database operations including SELECT queries, schema exploration, table metadata inspection, and result set analysis. This allows AI assistants to help developers understand their data structures, generate insights from existing data, and troubleshoot database-related issues. 

By providing read-only access, it maintains database integrity while enabling powerful AI-assisted data exploration capabilities across development, testing, and production environments.
