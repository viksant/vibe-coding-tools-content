AgentRPC is a flexible remote procedure call framework that helps developers share and use functions across various programming languages and network settings. By wrapping existing functions in a standardized RPC interface, it allows easy access through a hosted server that adheres to open standards like MCP. This approach removes the hassle of creating custom APIs and makes it easier for different languages to work together.

One of the best parts? The framework takes care of serialization, authentication, and network communication behind the scenes. This means developers can concentrate on what really matters: their business logic.

AgentRPC shines in microservices architectures, distributed systems, and environments with multiple programming languages where different components need to communicate smoothly.

It also supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls, includes built-in error handling, and provides monitoring tools for production setups. This combination makes it a powerful choice for developers looking for a reliable way to connect their applications.
