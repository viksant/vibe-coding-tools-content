# AgentRPC

AgentRPC is a versatile remote procedure call framework that enables developers to expose and consume functions across different programming languages and network environments. It wraps existing functions in a standardized RPC interface, making them accessible through a hosted server that supports open standards including MCP. This eliminates the need for custom API development and simplifies cross-language interoperability.

The framework handles serialization, authentication, and network communication transparently, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure. It's particularly valuable for microservices architectures, distributed systems, and polyglot environments where different components need to communicate seamlessly. AgentRPC supports both synchronous and asynchronous calls, provides built-in error handling, and offers monitoring capabilities for production deployments.
