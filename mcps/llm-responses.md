This MCP provides TypeScript-based tools for submitting and retrieving LLM responses, allowing developers to orchestrate collaborative AI workflows where multiple language models can work together on complex problems.

By enabling different LLMs to share their perspectives on identical prompts, it facilitates richer analysis, consensus-building, and complementary problem-solving approaches that leverage the unique strengths of each model.

The system supports various use cases including comparative response analysis, ensemble methods for improved accuracy, and multi-agent AI systems where specialized models contribute different expertise.

Developers can build applications that benefit from diverse AI perspectives, create validation systems that cross-check responses, and implement sophisticated AI collaboration pipelines that go beyond single-model limitations.
