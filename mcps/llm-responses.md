This MCP offers tools based on TypeScript for submitting and retrieving responses from large language models (LLMs). It helps developers create collaborative AI workflows where multiple models can tackle complex problems together.

By allowing different LLMs to weigh in on the same prompts, this setup encourages deeper analysis, helps build consensus, and promotes various problem-solving strategies that take advantage of each model's unique strengths.

You can use this system for a range of applications, such as comparing responses, using ensemble methods to boost accuracy, and building multi-agent AI systems where specialized models bring their own expertise to the table.

With these tools, developers can create applications that harness diverse AI perspectives, set up validation systems that cross-check responses, and design advanced AI collaboration pipelines that push beyond the limits of a single model.
