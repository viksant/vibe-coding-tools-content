# MCP Installer

The MCP Installer enables AI assistants to dynamically discover, install, and configure additional Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers at runtime. This eliminates the need for pre-configured server setups, allowing assistants to adapt to new requirements by installing specialized MCP servers for specific tasks like database access, API integrations, or custom tooling. The installer handles dependency resolution, version management, and configuration validation to ensure seamless integration.

Developers benefit from enhanced flexibility as they can extend assistant capabilities without rebuilding core systems. Use cases include on-demand installation of database connectors, API clients, or domain-specific tools based on real-time user needs. This dynamic approach supports scalable AI architectures where assistants can grow their toolset organically, making it ideal for environments requiring rapid adaptation to changing data sources or workflow requirements.
