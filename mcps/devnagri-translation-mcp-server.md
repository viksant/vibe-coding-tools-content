# Devnagri Translation MCP Server

The Devnagri Translation MCP Server is a JavaScript-based implementation of the Model Context Protocol that provides robust translation services, language detection, and supported language listing through Devnagri's specialized AI APIs. This server excels at handling Indic languages, making it particularly valuable for developers working with regional language support in applications. It enables seamless integration with popular AI tools like Claude, GPT, Windsurf, and Cursor, allowing developers to incorporate sophisticated translation capabilities directly into their development workflows.

The server is designed for rapid deployment and integration, supporting both NPX execution and local setup configurations. This flexibility ensures that developers can quickly incorporate translation services without complex infrastructure requirements. The MCP protocol implementation ensures standardized communication, making it easy to maintain and extend translation capabilities across different development environments and tools.
