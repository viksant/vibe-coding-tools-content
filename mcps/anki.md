# Anki

The Anki MCP provides seamless integration with Anki's powerful spaced repetition system through the AnkiConnect API. This enables developers to programmatically create, modify, and organize flashcards, decks, and notes directly from their development environment. The integration supports advanced search capabilities, deck management, and note synchronization, making it ideal for building custom learning tools or integrating spaced repetition into educational applications.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create automated flashcard generation from code documentation, build custom learning interfaces, or integrate spaced repetition into developer onboarding and training workflows. The API supports full CRUD operations on notes and decks, allowing for dynamic content updates and personalized learning paths based on user progress and performance metrics.
