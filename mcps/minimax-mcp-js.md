# MiniMax-MCP-JS

The official MiniMax Model Context Protocol JavaScript implementation provides seamless browser and Node.js integration with MiniMax's comprehensive AI services. This MCP enables web developers to incorporate text-to-image generation, text-to-video conversion, image-to-video transformation, text-to-speech synthesis, and voice cloning capabilities directly into their JavaScript applications. The implementation supports both client-side and server-side usage, making it perfect for web applications, browser extensions, and serverless functions that require advanced generative AI features with minimal setup complexity.
