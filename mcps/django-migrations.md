# Django Migrations

This MCP provides robust tooling for managing Django migrations in distributed service architectures. It enables coordinated execution of database schema changes across multiple services, ensuring migrations are applied in the correct order and maintaining data integrity throughout the system. The tooling includes safety checks, rollback capabilities, and dependency management to prevent common migration issues like conflicts or partial updates.

For large-scale projects with multiple Django services sharing databases or requiring synchronized schema changes, this MCP dramatically reduces deployment risks. It supports complex migration patterns including data migrations, schema alterations, and cross-service dependencies. Development teams can confidently deploy database changes knowing that all services will maintain compatibility, while operations teams benefit from automated coordination and comprehensive audit trails of schema evolution.
