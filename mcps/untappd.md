# Untappd

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Untappd API, enabling developers to programmatically access the world's largest beer database. You can search for beers by name, brewery, or style, retrieve detailed information including ABV, IBU, ratings, and descriptions, and access user check-in data for analysis. This is ideal for building beer recommendation engines, brewery analytics dashboards, or social drinking applications that leverage real-time beer data and community ratings.

The integration supports authentication workflows and handles API rate limiting, making it suitable for production applications. Developers can use this to create personalized beer discovery experiences, track drinking habits, analyze market trends, or build social features around beer consumption. The MCP abstracts away the complexity of API interactions, providing clean interfaces for common Untappd operations while maintaining flexibility for custom implementations.
