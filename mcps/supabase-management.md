This MCP provides comprehensive control over Supabase projects and organizations, enabling developers to automate and manage their backend infrastructure programmatically. 

It supports operations such as project creation, configuration management, team collaboration settings, and resource monitoring through Supabase's REST API.

Developers can use this MCP to streamline development workflows, automate deployment processes, and maintain consistent configurations across environments. 

It's particularly valuable for teams building applications with Supabase's PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features, allowing for efficient infrastructure management alongside application development.
