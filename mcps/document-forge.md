Document Forge offers developers a single API that makes it easy to work with different document formats. With this tool, you can effortlessly extract text and metadata, convert popular file types, and manipulate document content programmatically. This means no more juggling multiple libraries, which simplifies those tricky document workflows.

Imagine building applications that can process PDF invoices, convert DOCX reports to HTML for web display, parse CSV data for analysis, or even manage EPUB ebooksâ€”all with ease.

The MCP takes care of the format-specific details behind the scenes, providing a consistent interface. This feature makes it a fantastic choice for content management systems, data processing pipelines, and tools that automate document generation.
