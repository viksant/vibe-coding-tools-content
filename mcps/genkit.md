This MCP server connects Genkit AI development workflows with external tools using the Model Context Protocol. It lets developers access MCP resources—like tools, data sources, and APIs—directly in their Genkit applications. At the same time, it allows Genkit's AI capabilities to be available as MCP-compatible tools for others to use.

Let's break it down. Developers can tap into this connection to enrich their Genkit applications with external data, specialized tools, and services from third parties. 

On the flip side, they can also share their Genkit AI workflows with other applications that are compatible with MCP. This two-way functionality supports intricate AI orchestration, multi-tool workflows, and distributed AI system designs. In this setup, Genkit acts as both a consumer and a provider of MCP resources.
