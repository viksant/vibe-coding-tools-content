# Genkit

This MCP server provides seamless integration between Genkit AI development workflows and external tools through the Model Context Protocol. It enables developers to consume MCP resources (tools, data sources, APIs) directly within their Genkit applications, while also exposing Genkit's own AI capabilities as MCP-compatible tools for external consumption.

Developers can leverage this bridge to enhance their Genkit applications with external data sources, specialized tools, and third-party services, while simultaneously making their Genkit AI workflows available to other MCP-compatible applications. This bidirectional capability supports complex AI orchestration scenarios, multi-tool workflows, and distributed AI system architectures where Genkit serves as both consumer and provider of MCP resources.
