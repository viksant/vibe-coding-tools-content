Cloud Foundry Hoover acts as a central hub for managing data in Cloud Foundry environments. It connects with various cf-butler instances—tools that help with cleanup and management—and gathers their operational data into one easy-to-read view.

Why does this matter? It allows for better monitoring and management across different Cloud Foundry setups. By collecting metrics, resource usage data, and cleanup suggestions from multiple cf-butler instances, Cloud Foundry Hoover gives developers and platform operators a clearer picture of their Cloud Foundry environment.

With this information, teams can optimize their resources more effectively, spot orphaned resources, and streamline their automated cleanup processes. This feature is especially useful for organizations that operate multiple Cloud Foundry foundations or large deployments that need centralized management.
