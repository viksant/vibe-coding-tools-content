# Cloud Foundry Hoover

Cloud Foundry Hoover serves as a centralized registry and data aggregation service specifically designed for Cloud Foundry environments. It systematically queries multiple cf-butler instances—tools that provide cleanup and management capabilities for Cloud Foundry—and aggregates their operational data into a unified view. This enables comprehensive monitoring and management across distributed Cloud Foundry deployments.

By collecting and consolidating metrics, resource usage statistics, and cleanup recommendations from various cf-butler instances, Cloud Foundry Hoover provides developers and platform operators with valuable insights into their Cloud Foundry ecosystem. This facilitates better resource optimization, identifies orphaned resources, and supports automated cleanup workflows. The aggregation capability is particularly beneficial for organizations running multiple Cloud Foundry foundations or large-scale deployments that require centralized oversight and management.
