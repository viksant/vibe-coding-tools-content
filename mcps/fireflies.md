# Fireflies

The Fireflies MCP enables developers to programmatically access and process meeting transcripts through the Fireflies.ai API. This integration allows for automated retrieval of meeting content, advanced search capabilities across transcript archives, and AI-powered summarization of key discussion points and action items. Developers can build applications that analyze meeting patterns, extract insights from conversations, and create intelligent meeting assistants.

This MCP is particularly valuable for building productivity tools, meeting analytics platforms, and AI assistants that need to understand and process conversational data. Use cases include automated meeting minutes generation, sentiment analysis of team discussions, tracking action items across meetings, and creating searchable knowledge bases from recorded conversations. The API handles the complexity of speech-to-text conversion and provides structured access to transcribed content.
