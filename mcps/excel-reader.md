The Excel Reader MCP provides a programmatic interface to extract and manipulate data from Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx, .xls formats). 

It enables developers to read specific sheets, ranges, and cells, transforming raw spreadsheet data into structured formats suitable for further processing. This eliminates manual data entry and allows for seamless integration of spreadsheet data into automated workflows.

Common use cases include generating automated reports from business data, migrating spreadsheet data to databases, performing batch data validation, and feeding Excel-based information into data analysis pipelines. 

By automating Excel data extraction, this MCP significantly reduces manual effort and enables reliable, repeatable data processing operations across various business and technical scenarios.
