# Rememberizer

The Rememberizer MCP enables developers to integrate sophisticated semantic search capabilities into their applications using Rememberizer's document API. This tool allows you to index and retrieve enterprise knowledge with AI-powered understanding, going beyond simple keyword matching to find conceptually relevant information based on meaning and context.

Developers can use this MCP to build intelligent knowledge management systems, internal search engines, and AI assistants that understand natural language queries. The API handles document processing, embedding generation, and semantic similarity matching, making it ideal for enterprises dealing with large volumes of documentation, research materials, or customer support content where traditional search falls short.
