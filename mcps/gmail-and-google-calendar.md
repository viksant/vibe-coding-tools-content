# Gmail and Google Calendar

This MCP provides comprehensive integration with Google's Gmail and Calendar APIs, enabling developers to build applications that automate email workflows and calendar management. With Gmail capabilities, you can programmatically retrieve emails, search through messages with advanced filters, send emails with attachments, and manage labels and threads. The Calendar integration allows for creating, updating, and deleting events, managing attendees, and automatically generating Google Meet video conference links for seamless virtual meetings.

This MCP is ideal for building productivity tools, automated notification systems, scheduling assistants, and workflow automation platforms. Developers can create applications that sync communication and scheduling data, send automated email responses based on calendar availability, or build custom calendar management interfaces. The unified API access simplifies working with both email and calendar data, reducing the complexity of managing OAuth flows and API rate limits across multiple Google services.
