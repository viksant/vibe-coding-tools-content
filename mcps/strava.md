# Strava

The Strava MCP provides seamless integration with Strava's comprehensive fitness API, enabling developers to programmatically access detailed activity data, athlete statistics, and performance metrics. This integration allows for the retrieval of workout information including distance, pace, heart rate, elevation gain, and route maps, which can be used to build applications that analyze training patterns, track progress over time, and generate personalized fitness insights.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create data-driven fitness applications, coaching tools, or health dashboards that connect directly to the Strava ecosystem. It supports authentication flows, pagination for large datasets, and real-time webhook subscriptions for new activities, making it ideal for building applications that require up-to-date athletic data for performance analysis, social fitness challenges, or personalized training recommendations.
