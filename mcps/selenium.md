This MCP provides programmatic control over web browsers through Selenium WebDriver, enabling developers to automate complex user interactions, form submissions, and dynamic content handling. 

It supports cross-browser testing across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, making it ideal for end-to-end testing, web scraping, and UI validation workflows.

By integrating Selenium's powerful automation capabilities, developers can create reliable test suites, perform regression testing, and automate repetitive web tasks. 

The MCP handles element location, JavaScript execution, and browser navigation, reducing manual testing efforts and ensuring consistent behavior across different browser environments and versions.
