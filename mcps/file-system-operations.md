# File System Operations

This MCP provides comprehensive file system operations that enable developers to interact with the local file system through standardized APIs. It supports essential operations including reading file contents, creating new files, and listing directory contents, making it ideal for applications that need to manage local data storage, configuration files, or user-generated content.

The integration with Sentry adds robust performance monitoring capabilities, allowing developers to track file operation metrics, identify bottlenecks, and monitor system health. This is particularly valuable for applications requiring reliable file I/O operations, such as desktop applications, development tools, data processing pipelines, and content management systems where performance and error tracking are critical.
