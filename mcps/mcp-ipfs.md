The MCP-IPFS server connects language models and MCP clients directly to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). 

With this setup, AI agents can easily upload, retrieve, pin, and manage content across various distributed IPFS networks. 

Developers gain the ability to create applications that tap into decentralized storage, content addressing, and peer-to-peer file sharingâ€”all from within their MCP environment. 

This functionality opens up exciting possibilities for Web3, decentralized applications, and managing content in a distributed way.
