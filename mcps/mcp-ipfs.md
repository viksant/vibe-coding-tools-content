# MCP-IPFS

The MCP-IPFS server provides language models and MCP clients with direct access to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) functionality. This allows AI agents to upload, retrieve, pin, and manage content across distributed IPFS networks seamlessly. Developers can build applications that leverage decentralized storage, content addressing, and peer-to-peer file sharing without leaving their MCP environment, enabling new use cases in Web3, decentralized applications, and distributed content management.
