The Blockchain Data server by Tatum MCP makes it easy for developers to connect with over 130 blockchain networks using one simple interface. Youâ€™ll find support for well-known protocols like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Solana. This means you can access important blockchain data such as blocks, transactions, balances, and network information all in one place.

Think of the server as a helpful gateway to blockchain RPC endpoints. It lets you perform both read and write operations across different chains seamlessly.

With this MCP, developers can create decentralized applications, query on-chain data, and submit transactions without the hassle of managing individual node infrastructure. It streamlines the process of integrating blockchain technology by providing a single access point to a variety of networks. This approach minimizes complexity and speeds up development for applications in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain interoperability.

This tool works great for projects that need multi-chain support and real-time interactions with blockchain data.
