# Blockchain Data by Tatum

The Blockchain Data by Tatum MCP server enables developers to interact with over 130 blockchain networks through a unified interface. This includes major protocols like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, and Solana, providing access to blockchain data such as blocks, transactions, balances, and network information. The server acts as a gateway to blockchain RPC endpoints, allowing both read and write operations across multiple chains.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build decentralized applications, query on-chain data, and submit transactions without managing individual node infrastructure. It simplifies blockchain integration by offering a single point of access to diverse networks, reducing complexity and accelerating development for use cases like DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain interoperability. The tool is ideal for projects requiring multi-chain support and real-time blockchain interactions.
