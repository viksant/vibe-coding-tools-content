# dbSNP

This MCP provides a seamless bridge to NCBI's dbSNP (Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), enabling developers to programmatically access comprehensive genetic variant information. It offers robust search functionality to query SNPs by ID, gene, or genomic region, and retrieves detailed data including allele frequencies, genomic coordinates, and functional annotations. The MCP handles API rate limiting automatically, ensuring reliable access to this critical biomedical resource.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications for precision medicine, genetic research, and clinical diagnostics. Use cases include variant annotation pipelines, pharmacogenomics tools, and population genetics studies. The clinical significance assessments enable filtering of medically relevant variants, supporting applications in genetic counseling and disease risk prediction while maintaining compliance with NCBI's access policies through built-in rate limit management.
