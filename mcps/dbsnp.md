This MCP connects effortlessly to NCBI's dbSNP, which is the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms. It allows developers to access detailed genetic variant information programmatically.

With its powerful search features, you can easily query SNPs by ID, gene, or genomic region. It also retrieves in-depth data like allele frequencies, genomic coordinates, and functional annotations. Plus, the MCP takes care of API rate limiting on its own, ensuring that you have reliable access to this important biomedical resource.

Developers can use this MCP to create applications focused on precision medicine, genetic research, and clinical diagnostics. Think of use cases like variant annotation pipelines, pharmacogenomics tools, and studies in population genetics.

The assessments of clinical significance help you filter out medically relevant variants. This supports applications in genetic counseling and disease risk prediction while ensuring that you stay compliant with NCBI's access policies, thanks to the built-in rate limit management.
