# Scrapeless MCP Server

The Scrapeless MCP Server enables seamless integration of real-time web data extraction into LLM applications. It provides access to Google SERP results and other web content through Scrapeless's powerful scraping browser technology, which handles complex JavaScript rendering, anti-bot bypassing, and session management. Developers can perform single-page crawling or full-depth recursive crawling operations, making it ideal for building applications that require fresh, structured data from the web without dealing with scraping infrastructure complexities.

The server simplifies large-scale data extraction workflows by handling browser automation, CAPTCHA solving, and anti-blocking measures automatically. This allows developers to focus on building intelligent applications that leverage real-time web data for market research, competitive analysis, content generation, and data-driven decision making without maintaining scraping infrastructure.
