# Higress AI Search

Higress AI Search MCP integrates powerful search capabilities directly into AI model workflows, providing real-time access to diverse information sources. The system connects to internet search engines, academic databases, and internal knowledge repositories, enabling AI assistants to deliver responses enriched with current, relevant information. This eliminates the limitations of static training data by incorporating up-to-date facts, research findings, and organizational knowledge.

The MCP supports configurable search strategies that can prioritize different source types based on query context and user requirements. It handles complex information retrieval tasks including fact verification, research synthesis, and knowledge discovery. By bridging the gap between AI reasoning and real-world information, Higress AI Search ensures responses are accurate, timely, and contextually appropriate for professional and research applications.
