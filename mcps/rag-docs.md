# RAG Docs

RAG Docs MCP provides semantic search capabilities for documentation by leveraging Qdrant vector database technology. This enables developers to efficiently search and retrieve relevant information from large document collections using natural language queries rather than traditional keyword matching. The system automatically converts documentation into vector embeddings, allowing for intelligent similarity-based retrieval that understands the contextual meaning behind search queries.

This MCP is particularly valuable for developers working with extensive documentation sets, technical manuals, or API references. It supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows by providing accurate context retrieval for AI assistants, improves documentation discoverability, and reduces time spent searching for relevant information. Use cases include intelligent help systems, automated documentation assistants, and enhanced search functionality for developer portals and knowledge bases.
