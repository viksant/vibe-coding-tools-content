# Holaspirit

The Holaspirit MCP enables developers to programmatically interact with Holaspirit's organizational management platform through its REST API. This integration provides comprehensive access to organizational data including team structures, role definitions, accountabilities, and governance policies. Developers can automate tasks such as analyzing organizational hierarchies, managing role assignments, tracking decision-making processes, and reviewing policy compliance.

This MCP is particularly valuable for organizations practicing agile or teal organizational models, as it allows for automated reporting, synchronization with other HR systems, and real-time monitoring of organizational health. Use cases include generating organizational charts, auditing role responsibilities, ensuring policy adherence across teams, and integrating Holaspirit data with business intelligence tools for deeper insights into organizational dynamics and efficiency.
