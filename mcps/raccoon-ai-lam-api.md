# Raccoon AI (LAM API)

Raccoon AI MCP provides programmatic access to web browsing, data extraction, and task automation capabilities through Raccoon's Large Action Model (LAM) API. This enables developers to automate interactions with websites, including searching content, filling forms, navigating UI elements, and extracting structured data based on custom schemas. The MCP abstracts the complexity of web automation, handling dynamic content, JavaScript rendering, and anti-bot measures.

Use cases include web scraping for market research, automated testing of web applications, data aggregation from multiple sources, and workflow automation that requires web interaction. Developers can define extraction schemas to get clean, structured data from web pages, making it ideal for building data pipelines, monitoring services, or creating automated assistants that interact with web interfaces. The API handles the underlying browser automation, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than low-level web interaction details.
