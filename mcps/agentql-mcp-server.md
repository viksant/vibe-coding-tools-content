The AgentQL MCP Server integrates AgentQL's advanced data extraction capabilities into the Model Context Protocol. This enables AI assistants to scrape web data, extract structured information from websites, and automate data collection workflows.

Developers can leverage this for market research, competitive analysis, content aggregation, and automated data processing from web sources using natural language commands.
