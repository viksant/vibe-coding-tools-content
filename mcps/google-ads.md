The Google Ads MCP Server connects Google's advertising platform with AI tools like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf, enabling natural language analysis of advertising data. 

This integration provides direct access to campaign performance metrics, keyword analytics, and ad management capabilities through conversational interfaces. 

Developers and marketers can query campaign data, optimize performance, and make data-driven decisions without switching between multiple tools or writing complex queries. 

This streamlines the advertising optimization process through intuitive chat-based interactions.
