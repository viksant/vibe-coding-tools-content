# FTP Server Manager

The FTP Server Manager MCP enables developers to interact with FTP and FTPS servers using natural language commands, eliminating the need for manual command-line tools or GUI clients. It supports essential file operations including directory listing, file upload/download, folder creation, and file deletion. This makes remote server management more accessible and efficient for developers working with file-based workflows.

This MCP is particularly valuable for web development, content management, and automated deployment pipelines where regular file synchronization with remote servers is required. By abstracting away complex FTP protocols and authentication details, it allows developers to focus on their core tasks while ensuring secure and reliable file transfers through FTPS support.
