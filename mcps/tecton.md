# Tecton

This MCP server provides seamless integration with Tecton feature stores, allowing data scientists and engineers to programmatically manage their feature infrastructure. It enables workspace discovery, feature store configuration retrieval, and operational management through a standardized interface. This integration streamlines ML pipeline development by providing consistent access to feature definitions, metadata, and deployment configurations.

Teams can use this MCP to automate feature store operations, synchronize feature definitions across environments, and maintain consistent feature governance. The server supports common workflows like feature validation, version tracking, and environment-specific configuration management, reducing manual overhead and ensuring reproducibility across machine learning projects.
