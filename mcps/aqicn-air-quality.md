This MCP connects effortlessly with the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API, allowing developers to access real-time air quality data from thousands of monitoring stations around the globe. 

You can easily query information by city name, station ID, or geographic coordinates. This gives you detailed insights, including AQI values, pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO, and even health recommendations.

With this data, developers can create applications focused on environmental monitoring, health advisories, and smart city solutions that adapt to air quality changes.

The MCP takes care of API authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization. This simplifies the process of adding trustworthy air quality information into weather apps, IoT devices, public health platforms, and environmental dashboards.
