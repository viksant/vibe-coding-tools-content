# AQICN Air Quality

This MCP provides seamless integration with the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API, enabling developers to retrieve comprehensive real-time air quality data from thousands of monitoring stations worldwide. It supports querying by city name, station ID, or geographic coordinates, delivering detailed metrics including AQI values, pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO), and health recommendations.

Developers can build environmental monitoring applications, health advisory services, and smart city solutions that respond to air quality conditions. The MCP handles API authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization, making it easy to incorporate reliable air quality information into weather apps, IoT devices, public health platforms, and environmental dashboards.
