# Unreal Engine Binary Reader

This MCP provides specialized tools for parsing and analyzing Unreal Engine asset files and generic binary structures. It enables developers to extract metadata, inspect file formats, and understand the internal structure of game assets without requiring access to Unreal Engine's full toolchain. This is particularly valuable for reverse engineering, modding, and technical analysis of game content.

The tool supports both Unreal Engine-specific file formats and generic binary analysis, making it useful for digital forensics, game development workflows, and educational purposes. Developers can quickly identify asset types, dependencies, and structural information, streamlining debugging and asset management processes across different versions of Unreal Engine projects.
