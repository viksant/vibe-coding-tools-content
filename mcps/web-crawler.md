# Web Crawler

This MCP provides a powerful web crawling solution that enables developers to programmatically extract structured content from websites while maintaining ethical crawling practices. The crawler automatically respects robots.txt rules and offers granular control over crawling parameters including depth limits, request delays, and concurrency settings to prevent overloading target servers.

Developers can use this MCP to build data collection pipelines, content aggregation systems, and competitive intelligence tools. It's particularly valuable for web scraping applications, SEO analysis, price monitoring, and research projects where reliable, structured data extraction from multiple web sources is required. The configurable nature makes it suitable for both small-scale targeted scraping and larger web archiving initiatives.
