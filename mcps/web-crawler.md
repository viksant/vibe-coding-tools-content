This MCP offers a robust web crawling solution that helps developers extract structured content from websites in a programmatic way while adhering to ethical standards.

The crawler automatically follows robots.txt rules, giving you control over various crawling parameters. You can set depth limits, adjust request delays, and manage concurrency settings to avoid overwhelming target servers.

With this MCP, developers can create data collection pipelines, content aggregation systems, and tools for competitive intelligence.

It's especially useful for web scraping tasks, SEO analysis, price monitoring, and research projects that need reliable, structured data from various web sources.

Thanks to its flexible design, this tool works well for both small-scale, focused scraping and larger web archiving projects.
