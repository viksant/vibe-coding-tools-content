# Chronulus AI Forecasting

This MCP provides seamless integration with Chronulus AI's powerful forecasting API, enabling developers to perform sophisticated time series analysis and generate accurate predictions using simple natural language commands. It abstracts away the complexity of traditional forecasting workflows, allowing you to query historical data, build predictive models, and retrieve forecasts without writing complex statistical code.

The tool supports comprehensive forecasting capabilities including trend analysis, seasonality detection, and anomaly identification across various domains like sales, finance, and operational metrics. Developers can visualize forecasting results, compare multiple models, and export predictions for integration into applications, dashboards, or reporting systems. This makes it ideal for building intelligent applications that require predictive analytics, automated forecasting pipelines, or data-driven decision support systems.
