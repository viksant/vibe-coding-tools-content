# Figma Context

The Figma Context MCP provides seamless integration with Figma's design platform API, enabling AI assistants to perform a wide range of design operations and asset management tasks. This integration allows developers and designers to automate repetitive design workflows, manage design systems, and collaborate more effectively within Figma's ecosystem. The MCP supports operations like fetching design files, extracting components, managing versions, and facilitating team collaboration through comments and notifications.

By leveraging this MCP, teams can enhance their design workflows with AI-powered automation, ensuring consistency across design assets and improving collaboration efficiency. Use cases include automated design system management, AI-assisted component extraction, version control synchronization, and real-time collaboration enhancements. This enables faster iteration cycles, reduces manual design tasks, and helps maintain design consistency across large-scale projects.
