# Document Reader

The Document Reader MCP provides developers with a powerful API for interacting with PDF and EPUB document formats. It enables reading document content, performing text analysis, and extracting structured information from files programmatically. This tool is essential for applications that need to process digital documents at scale, such as content management systems, research tools, and data extraction pipelines.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build automated document processing workflows, extract specific data points from contracts or reports, analyze document structure and content, and integrate document reading capabilities into larger applications. The MCP handles the complexities of different document formats, allowing developers to focus on building value-added features rather than parsing file formats.
