# Lighthouse MCP

Lighthouse MCP leverages Google's Lighthouse tool to measure critical web performance metrics including load times, SEO, accessibility, and best practices. AI assistants can analyze these metrics and provide actionable optimization recommendations, enabling developers to run agentic loops that automatically enhance site performance. This integration helps teams maintain high-performance web applications, improve user experience scores, and systematically address performance bottlenecks through AI-powered insights and automated fixes.
