This MCP server extracts and parses Xcode build diagnostics from DerivedData logs, transforming raw compiler output into structured diagnostic information. 

It captures detailed error and warning data including file paths, line numbers, error messages, and fix-it suggestions, making it easier to identify and resolve build issues in Swift projects.

The tool enables developers to programmatically access build diagnostics for integration with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing frameworks, and developer tools. 

By providing machine-readable diagnostic data, it supports automated error analysis, build monitoring, and intelligent code assistance workflows that help teams maintain code quality and accelerate development cycles.
