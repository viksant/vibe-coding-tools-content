This MCP server takes the Xcode build diagnostics from DerivedData logs and turns the raw compiler output into organized diagnostic information. 

It collects important details like error and warning data, including file paths, line numbers, error messages, and suggestions for fixes. This makes it much simpler to spot and tackle build issues in Swift projects. 

Developers can use this tool to access build diagnostics programmatically, which is perfect for integrating with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing frameworks, and other developer tools. 

By offering machine-readable diagnostic data, it helps with automated error analysis, keeps an eye on builds, and supports smart code assistance workflows. This way, teams can maintain high code quality and speed up their development cycles.
