# Sumo Logic

The Sumo Logic MCP provides seamless integration with the Sumo Logic cloud-native observability platform, allowing developers to programmatically search, analyze, and visualize log data. This enables real-time troubleshooting of application issues, performance monitoring, and generation of actionable insights from log streams. Developers can execute custom queries using Sumo Logic's powerful search processing language to filter, aggregate, and correlate log events across distributed systems.

This MCP is particularly valuable for DevOps and SRE teams who need to quickly diagnose production issues, monitor application health, and extract business intelligence from log data. It supports use cases like security incident investigation, compliance auditing, and operational analytics by providing structured access to log data through API calls. The integration helps teams move beyond manual log inspection to automated, data-driven decision making for their applications and infrastructure.
