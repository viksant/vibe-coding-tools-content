This MCP provides comprehensive project management capabilities specifically designed for software development workflows. 

It enables developers to view, add, update, and delete todo items with advanced features like priority setting, tagging, and project assignment. The integration allows for efficient task tracking across multiple projects and teams.

The system supports AI-assisted prioritization, helping developers focus on high-impact tasks and optimize their workflow. This is particularly valuable for managing technical debt, feature development, and bug tracking in complex software projects.

By providing structured task management with intelligent prioritization, it enhances productivity and ensures critical development tasks receive appropriate attention.
