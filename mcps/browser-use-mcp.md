Browser Use MCP enables sophisticated browser automation through Puppeteer integration, providing AI agents with structured accessibility snapshots instead of traditional screenshot-based approaches. 

This server allows LLMs to interact with web pages programmatically, performing tasks like form filling, content extraction, and navigation without requiring visual recognition models. 

The accessibility-focused approach ensures reliable web interactions by working directly with the DOM structure, making it ideal for web scraping, automated testing, and workflow automation applications that require precise and repeatable browser interactions.
