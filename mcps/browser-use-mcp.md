Browser Use MCP offers advanced browser automation by integrating with Puppeteer. This means AI agents can access structured snapshots of a webpage instead of relying on typical screenshots.

With this server, large language models (LLMs) can interact with web pages in a straightforward way. They can handle tasks like filling out forms, extracting content, and navigating sitesâ€”all without needing visual recognition models.

Focusing on accessibility allows for dependable web interactions. By working directly with the DOM structure, this tool is perfect for web scraping, automated testing, and automation workflows that need accurate and repeatable browser actions.
