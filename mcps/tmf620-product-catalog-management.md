# TMF620 Product Catalog Management

This MCP provides a seamless integration with the TM Forum's TMF620 Product Catalog Management API, enabling developers to programmatically manage complex product catalogs used in e-commerce and telecommunications. It supports core operations like listing available catalogs, retrieving detailed product offerings and specifications, and creating new catalog entries with structured data. This allows for efficient management of product hierarchies, pricing models, and service definitions across distributed systems.

By abstracting the underlying API complexity, this MCP accelerates development of catalog-driven applications, ensuring compliance with industry standards while reducing integration time. Use cases include building dynamic product configurators, automated service provisioning systems, and unified commerce platforms that require consistent product information management across multiple channels and business units.
