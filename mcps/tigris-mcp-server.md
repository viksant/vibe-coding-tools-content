The Tigris MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol to create a seamless bridge between AI agents and Tigris cloud storage services. 

This server provides direct access to Tigris's core features, including comprehensive bucket management, object operations, and storage configuration capabilities. By exposing these cloud storage functionalities through the standardized MCP protocol, developers can integrate sophisticated storage operations directly into their AI-powered development tools and workflows.

The server enables AI agents to perform complex storage operations programmatically, including file uploads, downloads, metadata management, and bucket configuration. 

This integration is particularly valuable for applications requiring automated data management, content distribution, or persistent storage solutions. The MCP implementation ensures that these storage capabilities are accessible across different development environments and tools, providing a consistent interface for cloud storage operations regardless of the specific AI agent or development platform being used.
