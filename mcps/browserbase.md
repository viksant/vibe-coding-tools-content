The Browserbase MCP server enables AI models to automate web interactions through cloud-based browser instances. 

It provides capabilities for navigating websites, capturing screenshots, and executing JavaScript code in real browser environments. This allows developers to build applications that can scrape web data, automate testing workflows, or interact with web applications programmatically without maintaining local browser infrastructure. 

The integration with Puppeteer and upcoming Stagehand support ensures reliable and scalable browser automation for production use cases.
