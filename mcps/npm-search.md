# Npm Search

The Npm Search MCP provides a command-line interface for searching the npm registry, enabling developers to quickly find and evaluate JavaScript packages for their projects. This tool streamlines the process of discovering libraries, checking package details, and comparing alternatives without leaving the terminal environment.

By integrating npm search capabilities directly into development workflows, this MCP helps developers make informed decisions about dependencies, verify package availability, and maintain up-to-date knowledge of the JavaScript ecosystem. It's particularly valuable for dependency management, project research, and staying current with package updates and alternatives.
