This MCP server provides a bridge between AI assistants and Trinity's powerful formula-based computational tools through a Go-based JSON-RPC interface. 

It enables AI systems to programmatically access Trinity's advanced mathematical and analytical capabilities, allowing for complex formula evaluation, data processing, and computational workflows that would otherwise require manual interaction with Trinity's specialized tools.

Developers can leverage this integration to build intelligent applications that combine AI reasoning with Trinity's computational engine. 

Use cases include automated financial modeling, scientific data analysis, engineering calculations, and business intelligence systems where AI agents can dynamically generate and evaluate complex formulas based on real-time data inputs and contextual requirements.
