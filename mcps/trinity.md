This MCP server acts as a connector between AI assistants and Trinity's powerful formula-based computational tools using a Go-based JSON-RPC interface.

With this setup, AI systems can easily tap into Trinity's advanced mathematical and analytical features. This access allows for evaluating complex formulas, processing data, and managing workflows that typically require hands-on work with Trinity's specialized tools.

Developers can take advantage of this integration to create smart applications that blend AI reasoning with Trinity's computational capabilities.

Youâ€™ll find many interesting use cases, such as automated financial modeling, scientific data analysis, engineering calculations, and business intelligence systems. In these scenarios, AI agents can dynamically create and assess complex formulas based on real-time data and specific needs.
