This MCP acts as a link between AI systems and Rayon Design CAD, making it easier to interact with the CAD interface through browser automation.

With this setup, AI agents can create geometric shapes, search for drawing methods, and adjust design elements in Rayon's web-based CAD environment. This integration changes how designers operate by bringing AI support right into their CAD workflow.

Developers can create design tools powered by AI that take care of repetitive tasks, generate different design options, and offer smart drawing help.

Some practical applications include generating floor plans automatically, exploring parametric designs, and optimizing designs using AI.

The MCP also encourages teamwork in design, allowing AI agents to collaborate with human designers. They can suggest improvements and manage routine drawing tasks, all while keeping the user-friendly nature of Rayon's interface.
