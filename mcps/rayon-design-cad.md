# Rayon Design CAD

This MCP provides a bridge between AI systems and Rayon Design CAD, allowing automated interaction with the CAD interface through browser automation. It enables AI agents to programmatically create geometric shapes, search for drawing methods, and manipulate design elements within Rayon's web-based CAD environment. This integration transforms how designers work by bringing AI assistance directly into the CAD workflow.

Developers can build AI-powered design tools that automate repetitive tasks, generate design variations, and provide intelligent drawing assistance. Use cases include automated floor plan generation, parametric design exploration, and AI-driven design optimization. The MCP supports collaborative design workflows where AI agents can work alongside human designers, suggesting improvements and handling routine drawing tasks while maintaining the flexibility of Rayon's intuitive interface.
