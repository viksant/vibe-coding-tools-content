The Obsidian MCP server makes it easy for AI models to tap into the knowledge stored in Obsidian vaults. It offers impressive search and retrieval options for your Markdown notes.

With this integration, developers can create apps that dig into personal knowledge bases, pull insights from linked notes, and help manage knowledge workflows. 

The server can read note content, search through different vaults, and grasp how various pieces of information connect. This capability is perfect for crafting AI research assistants, organizing content, and discovering new knowledge.
