# Obsidian

The Obsidian MCP server enables AI models to access and process knowledge stored in Obsidian vaults, providing powerful search and retrieval capabilities for Markdown notes. This integration allows developers to build applications that can analyze personal knowledge bases, extract insights from interconnected notes, and assist with knowledge management workflows. The server supports reading note content, searching across vaults, and understanding the relationships between different pieces of information, making it ideal for building AI-powered research assistants, content organizers, and knowledge discovery tools.
