# GBOX Android MCP

GBOX Android MCP provides virtual environments where AI agents can directly interact with and control both mobile and desktop systems. For Android development, agents can build, test, and debug applications in real device environments, while also automating mobile tasks like app interactions and UI testing. On desktop systems, agents gain control over applications including browsers, terminals, and IDEs like VSCode, enabling comprehensive automation workflows across development environments.

This MCP integrates seamlessly with popular AI agent platforms such as Cursor and Claude Code, instantly granting them device operation capabilities. Developers benefit from automated testing, CI/CD pipeline integration, and hands-free device management, making it ideal for mobile app development, QA automation, and cross-platform testing scenarios where direct device control is essential.
