ArcKnowledge MCP offers a powerful way to manage your knowledge. You can register, manage, and query your document sources using simple webhook endpoints.

Adding new knowledge sources is a breeze. Just provide the URL, a description, and your API keys. This helps you create a centralized knowledge repository where everything is neatly organized.

With this system, you can perform smart queries across all your registered sources or focus on specific subsets. This makes it easy for your AI development tools to access the knowledge your organization holds.
