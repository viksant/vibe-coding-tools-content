# DevDb MCP Server

The DevDb MCP Server provides a unified interface for interacting with multiple relational database systems through the Model Context Protocol. This server enables developers to execute SQL queries, manage database schemas, and perform data operations across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server databases without needing to write database-specific connection code. It handles connection pooling, parameterized queries, and transaction management, making database interactions more secure and efficient.

By abstracting away the differences between database systems, the DevDb MCP Server simplifies application development and testing workflows. Developers can build database-agnostic tools, migrate between database backends more easily, and create consistent testing environments. This is particularly valuable for projects that need to support multiple database platforms or for teams working in heterogeneous database environments.
