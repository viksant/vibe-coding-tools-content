# Git Forensics

Git Forensics MCP provides comprehensive git repository analysis capabilities that go beyond basic version control operations. It enables developers to gain deep insights into repository history, branch relationships, and development patterns through sophisticated forensic examination tools. This includes detailed branch overviews showing divergence points, commit frequency analysis, and contributor activity tracking across specified time periods.

The MCP's intelligent merge recommendation system analyzes branch histories to identify optimal merge strategies, detect potential conflicts early, and suggest workflow improvements. By examining commit patterns, file changes, and collaboration dynamics, it helps teams optimize their development processes, reduce integration issues, and maintain cleaner repository structures. This is particularly valuable for large projects with multiple contributors, complex branching strategies, or legacy codebases requiring modernization.
