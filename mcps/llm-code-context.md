# LLM Code Context

The LLM Code Context MCP provides intelligent tools for sharing code context with large language models, enabling more effective code reviews, documentation generation, and AI-assisted development. It implements smart file selection algorithms that automatically identify relevant code files based on project structure and dependencies, while code outlining creates structured summaries of complex codebases for better LLM comprehension.

This MCP supports multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it versatile across different tech stacks. Developers can use it to generate comprehensive code documentation, perform automated code reviews, and enhance AI pair programming experiences. The system optimizes context sharing by filtering irrelevant files and creating meaningful code abstractions, significantly improving the quality of LLM interactions with codebases.
