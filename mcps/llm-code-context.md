The LLM Code Context MCP offers smart tools that help you share code context with large language models. This makes tasks like code reviews, documentation generation, and AI-assisted development more effective.

Let’s break it down. It uses intelligent file selection algorithms that automatically find the right code files based on your project's structure and dependencies. At the same time, code outlining helps create structured summaries of complex codebases, which makes it easier for the LLM to understand.

What’s great is that this MCP works with multiple programming languages and frameworks, giving it flexibility across various tech stacks. Developers can leverage it to generate detailed code documentation, carry out automated code reviews, and improve experiences with AI pair programming.

This system enhances context sharing by filtering out unnecessary files and crafting meaningful code abstractions. As a result, it significantly boosts the quality of LLM interactions with your codebases.
