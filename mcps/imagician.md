# imagician

Imagician is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides developers with a powerful toolkit for programmatic image manipulation. Built on the high-performance sharp library, it enables seamless integration of image processing capabilities into applications through a standardized API interface. Developers can perform operations like resizing, cropping, format conversion, compression, and quality optimization without deep expertise in image processing libraries.

This MCP server is ideal for applications requiring dynamic image handling, such as content management systems, e-commerce platforms, social media apps, and media processing pipelines. It abstracts the complexity of direct sharp library usage while maintaining optimal performance and image quality. By providing a unified interface for common image operations, Imagician accelerates development and ensures consistent results across different use cases.
