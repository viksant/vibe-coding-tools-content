ts-introspect is a handy tool for TypeScript introspection that operates as an MCP server. It dives deep into TypeScript packages and source code, pulling out extensive details about exported symbols. This includes functions, classes, types, constants, and their corresponding type signatures.

Hereâ€™s why this matters: AI assistants can now grasp codebases on a much deeper level, allowing them to offer precise, context-aware suggestions and refactoring advice.

The server gives developers the power to create smarter development tools that can easily navigate through complex TypeScript code. It helps generate type-safe code and delivers intelligent autocompletion features.

By revealing the complete type system and export structure of TypeScript modules, ts-introspect enables AI systems to analyze code dependencies, check interface compatibility, and understand type relationships. This makes it incredibly useful for large-scale TypeScript projects and library development.
