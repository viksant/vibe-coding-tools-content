# ts-introspect

ts-introspect is a TypeScript introspection tool that runs as an MCP server, providing detailed analysis of TypeScript packages and source code. It extracts comprehensive information about exported symbols including functions, classes, types, constants, and their associated type signatures. This enables AI assistants to understand codebases deeply and provide accurate, context-aware suggestions and refactoring recommendations.

The server empowers developers to build smarter development tools that can navigate complex TypeScript codebases, generate type-safe code, and provide intelligent autocompletion. By exposing the full type system and export structure of TypeScript modules, it allows AI systems to reason about code dependencies, interface compatibility, and type relationships, making it invaluable for large-scale TypeScript projects and library development.
