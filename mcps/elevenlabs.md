# ElevenLabs

The ElevenLabs MCP server provides direct access to ElevenLabs' advanced text-to-speech and audio processing capabilities within development environments. This integration enables AI assistants and coding tools to generate high-quality speech output, clone voices, transcribe audio content, and perform various audio manipulations programmatically. Developers can leverage these features for creating voice-enabled applications, generating audio content, or building accessibility features directly from their coding workflow.

The server supports multiple voice models, language options, and audio formats, making it suitable for diverse applications including content creation, educational tools, and voice interface development. By bringing professional-grade audio generation capabilities into the development environment, this MCP empowers developers to experiment with and implement voice features without context switching between different platforms or tools.
