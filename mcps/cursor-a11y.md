Cursor A11y MCP uses Puppeteer to make accessibility testing easy and automatic. It scans web applications for violations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to help ensure everyone can access your site.

Here's how it works: the tool audits various aspects of your pages, including their structure, ARIA attributes, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and compatibility with screen readers. After the scan, it produces detailed reports that highlight specific failure points and their severity levels.

This MCP helps developers identify accessibility issues early on in the development process. It offers practical suggestions for fixing problems and even provides code snippets to make corrections easier.

Teams can seamlessly integrate these automated checks into their CI/CD pipelines. This approach maintains continuous accessibility compliance while cutting down on manual testing efforts. Ultimately, it leads to a better overall user experience for individuals with disabilities.
