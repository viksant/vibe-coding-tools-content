Cursor A11y MCP integrates Puppeteer-powered accessibility testing to automatically scan web applications for WCAG compliance violations. 

It performs comprehensive audits of page structure, ARIA attributes, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility, generating detailed reports with specific failure points and severity levels.

This MCP enables developers to catch accessibility issues early in the development cycle by providing actionable remediation suggestions and code fixes. 

Teams can integrate these automated checks into their CI/CD pipelines, ensuring continuous accessibility compliance while reducing manual testing efforts and improving overall user experience for people with disabilities.
