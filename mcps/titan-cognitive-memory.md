Titan Cognitive Memory offers smart memory storage and retrieval features that help manage context during long conversations and complex reasoning tasks. With this Memory Control Protocol (MCP), AI systems can keep track of previous interactions, which means there's no need to start from scratch each time a new session begins.

Developers can take advantage of this memory system when building applications that need ongoing reasoning over time. Think about multi-session chatbots, advanced problem-solving assistants, or tools for automating workflows.

The memory layer allows for advanced querying and retrieval methods. This capability enables AI agents to pull in relevant past context while filtering out irrelevant information. The result? More coherent and intelligent interactions that feel natural and seamless.
