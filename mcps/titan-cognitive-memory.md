# Titan Cognitive Memory

Titan Cognitive Memory provides efficient memory storage and retrieval capabilities that enable persistent context management across long-running conversations and complex reasoning tasks. This MCP allows AI systems to maintain continuity and build upon previous interactions, eliminating the need to repeatedly re-establish context with each new session.

Developers can leverage this memory system to create applications that require sustained reasoning over extended periods, such as multi-session chatbots, complex problem-solving assistants, and workflow automation tools. The memory layer supports sophisticated querying and retrieval patterns, enabling AI agents to access relevant historical context while filtering out noise, ultimately leading to more coherent and intelligent interactions.
