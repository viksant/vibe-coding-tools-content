This MCP server connects to GitHub's Pull Request API to programmatically retrieve diff content from pull requests. It enables developers to build automated workflows that analyze code changes, perform quality checks, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines. 

The extracted diff data provides structured access to file changes, additions, deletions, and patch information. 

By exposing GitHub PR diffs through a standardized interface, this MCP facilitates automated code review systems, change impact analysis, and quality gate implementations. 

Developers can create intelligent workflows that trigger on PR events, analyze code patterns, enforce coding standards, and provide immediate feedback to contributors without manual intervention.
