iMCP is a macOS application that exposes Apple's native ecosystem through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, allowing AI assistants to programmatically interact with core system services. 

This enables developers to build AI-powered workflows that can send and receive iMessages, manage contacts, create and update reminders, and access other Apple-native functionality through a standardized API interface.

The MCP server bridges the gap between AI systems and macOS's tightly integrated applications, providing secure, authorized access to personal productivity tools. 

Use cases include automated message responses, intelligent contact management, AI-driven task scheduling, and building personalized productivity assistants that leverage the full power of Apple's ecosystem while maintaining user privacy and system security.
