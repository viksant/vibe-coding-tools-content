# ARC MCP

The ARC MCP server provides a bridge between AI assistants and ARC (Application Rapid Creator) by SourceFuse, a powerful SaaS application scaffolding tool. This integration allows developers to leverage AI capabilities for rapidly generating, customizing, and managing enterprise-grade applications through automated code scaffolding and project templating.

With this MCP, developers can streamline their SaaS development workflow by using natural language commands to create new applications, modify existing projects, and manage ARC-specific configurations. It enables rapid prototyping, reduces boilerplate code writing, and ensures consistent project structures across teams. The server is particularly valuable for teams building microservices, web applications, or full-stack solutions that require standardized scaffolding and accelerated development cycles.
