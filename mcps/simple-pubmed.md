# Simple PubMed

The Simple PubMed MCP provides programmatic access to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed database, enabling developers to search, retrieve, and analyze biomedical literature through the Entrez Programming Utilities API. This tool allows for efficient querying of millions of scientific articles, abstracts, and citations across various medical and life science disciplines.

Developers can build applications for literature review, research analysis, and scientific discovery workflows. Use cases include automated literature searches for systematic reviews, monitoring new publications in specific research areas, integrating scientific evidence into healthcare applications, and analyzing research trends across medical fields. The MCP simplifies complex API interactions, making biomedical data more accessible for research tools and healthcare applications.
