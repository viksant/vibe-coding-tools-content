# Text Saver

Text Saver MCP provides a reliable interface for persisting text content to the local filesystem with strong security and validation measures. It supports both user-defined filenames and automatic timestamp-based naming, ensuring organized storage while preventing file conflicts and overwrites. The tool includes comprehensive error handling for common filesystem issues like permission errors, invalid paths, and disk space constraints.

Developers can leverage Text Saver for logging application data, exporting user-generated content, creating backup files, or storing configuration snippets. Its validation system ensures filename safety by sanitizing inputs and checking for reserved characters, while the timestamp option provides audit trails for sequential data recording. This makes it ideal for applications requiring persistent text storage without external dependencies.
