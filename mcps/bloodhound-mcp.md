# BloodHound MCP

BloodHound MCP bridges cybersecurity and AI by enabling security professionals to query Active Directory environments through natural language. Instead of writing complex Cypher queries, users can describe attack paths and security relationships in plain English, making threat analysis more accessible to teams without deep technical expertise. This integration accelerates security assessments, reduces the learning curve for new analysts, and helps identify critical attack vectors faster through intuitive conversational interfaces.
