This MCP server offers a way for developers to tap into VirusTotal's extensive threat intelligence platform. It allows AI assistants to conduct security analysis and detect potential threats effectively.

With this integration, developers can easily query file hashes, URLs, domains, and IP addresses. They can then access detailed information such as reputation scores, detection ratios, and behavioral analysis reports from various antivirus engines and security vendors.

This setup is perfect for automating security workflows like malware analysis, incident response, and threat hunting. By using VirusTotal's vast database, developers can create applications that check suspicious files, keep an eye on malicious indicators, and strengthen their security stance through real-time threat intelligence feeds.
