# VirusTotal

This MCP server provides programmatic access to VirusTotal's comprehensive threat intelligence platform, enabling AI assistants to perform security analysis and threat detection tasks. Developers can query file hashes, URLs, domains, and IP addresses to retrieve detailed reputation scores, detection ratios, and behavioral analysis reports from multiple antivirus engines and security vendors.

The integration supports automated security workflows such as malware analysis, incident response, and threat hunting. By leveraging VirusTotal's extensive database, developers can build applications that validate suspicious files, monitor malicious indicators, and enhance their security posture through real-time threat intelligence feeds.
