# PubMed Search

This MCP provides seamless integration with PubMed's extensive biomedical literature database through the NCBI E-utilities API. Developers can programmatically search for academic papers using various criteria including keywords, authors, journals, and publication dates. The tool retrieves comprehensive paper metadata including titles, authors, journal information, abstracts, publication dates, and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), enabling efficient literature review and data extraction workflows.

The MCP is particularly valuable for researchers, bioinformaticians, and developers building applications that require access to up-to-date biomedical research. It supports complex search queries, result filtering, and batch processing of multiple papers. Use cases include systematic literature reviews, research dashboard development, citation management tools, and AI-powered research assistants that need to access and analyze scientific publications programmatically.
