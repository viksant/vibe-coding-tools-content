# X Twitter

The X Twitter MCP enables developers to automate social media operations by providing direct API access to X's platform. You can create, schedule, and publish posts, manage threads, and retrieve engagement metricsâ€”all through code. This is ideal for automating content pipelines, building social media dashboards, or integrating X into larger marketing or analytics workflows. By handling authentication and API complexities, the MCP lets you focus on building powerful social automation tools without wrestling with low-level HTTP requests or rate limiting. It supports both personal and business use cases, from automated news feeds to coordinated campaign publishing.
