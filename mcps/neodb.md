# NeoDB

The NeoDB MCP provides seamless integration with the NeoDB platform, enabling developers to programmatically access comprehensive book data and user information. This integration allows for fetching detailed book metadata, searching across extensive literary databases, and retrieving user-specific data such as reading history and preferences. Developers can build sophisticated applications that leverage this rich dataset for personalized book recommendations, intelligent reading list management, and advanced literary analysis.

The MCP supports various use cases including creating recommendation engines that suggest books based on user preferences and reading patterns, managing dynamic reading lists that sync with user accounts, and performing analytical queries for literary research or content discovery. By providing structured access to NeoDB's API endpoints, this MCP eliminates the complexity of direct API integration and offers a streamlined developer experience for building book-related applications with reliable data sourcing and consistent response formats.
