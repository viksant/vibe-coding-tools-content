This MCP provides seamless integration with Speckle, a leading platform for 3D design and AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) data management. 

It enables developers to programmatically list projects, retrieve detailed project information, search across project names and descriptions, and access specific model versions. This allows for automated workflows, data analysis, and integration with other tools in the AEC software ecosystem.

By exposing Speckle's core functionality through a standardized API interface, this MCP empowers professionals to build custom applications for project tracking, version control, and collaborative design review. 

It supports use cases such as automated reporting, design validation, and cross-platform data exchange, making it invaluable for teams working with complex 3D models and BIM data across the AEC industry.
