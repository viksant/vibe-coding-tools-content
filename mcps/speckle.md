This MCP connects smoothly with Speckle, a top platform for managing 3D design and AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) data.

With this integration, developers can easily list projects, pull up detailed project information, search through project names and descriptions, and access specific model versions. This flexibility fosters automated workflows, boosts data analysis, and allows for easy collaboration with other tools in the AEC software landscape.

By providing a standardized API interface, this MCP enables professionals to create custom applications for tracking projects, controlling versions, and conducting collaborative design reviews.

It supports various tasks like automated reporting, design validation, and data sharing across different platforms. This makes it a great asset for teams handling complex 3D models and BIM data in the AEC industry.
