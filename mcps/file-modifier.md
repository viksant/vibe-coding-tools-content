# File Modifier

The File Modifier MCP provides developers with precise control over text file manipulation through targeted operations including content addition, replacement, and deletion at specific locations. This tool eliminates the need for manual editing by allowing programmatic modifications based on line numbers, search patterns, or other precise identifiers.

Developers can use this MCP for automating configuration updates, code generation, template population, and batch file processing tasks. It supports use cases such as dynamically modifying environment variables in configuration files, updating version numbers across multiple files, or inserting generated code snippets at specific markers. The MCP ensures reliable file modifications while maintaining proper formatting and handling edge cases like file encoding and line endings.
