This MCP server bridges Claude Desktop with Eagle.cool, a powerful digital asset management tool used by designers, developers, and creative professionals. 

It enables Claude to interact directly with your Eagle library, allowing you to search, organize, and manage visual assets through natural language commands. You can ask Claude to find specific images, organize collections, add tags, or retrieve asset metadata without leaving your conversation.

The integration streamlines creative workflows by providing intelligent asset management assistance. Claude can help you categorize design resources, suggest organizational structures based on project needs, and quickly locate reference materials. 

This is particularly valuable for design teams, marketing agencies, and individual creators who need to maintain large libraries of images, icons, mockups, and other digital assets while focusing on their creative work.
