This MCP server connects Claude Desktop with Eagle.cool, a handy digital asset management tool for designers, developers, and creative professionals.

With this setup, Claude can directly interact with your Eagle library. You can simply ask Claude to find specific images, organize collections, add tags, or pull up asset metadata—all without interrupting your conversation.

Next, let’s talk about how this integration improves your creative workflow. Claude acts as a smart assistant for managing your assets. He can help you categorize design resources, suggest ways to organize them based on your project needs, and quickly track down reference materials.

This feature is especially useful for design teams, marketing agencies, and individual creators who manage extensive libraries of images, icons, mockups, and other digital assets. It allows them to focus more on their creative work while keeping everything organized.
