# DeepSRT

DeepSRT MCP enables developers to programmatically generate video summaries in multiple languages and formats (narrative or bullet-point) through DeepSRT's API. This integration provides direct access to advanced video processing capabilities, allowing applications to automatically create concise summaries from video content while supporting international audiences with multi-language output.

The service leverages content caching and CDN edge delivery to ensure efficient retrieval and distribution of generated summaries. This makes it ideal for applications requiring fast, scalable video summarization such as content management systems, e-learning platforms, media monitoring tools, and video analytics dashboards. Developers can focus on building their applications while relying on DeepSRT's infrastructure for optimal performance and global content delivery.
