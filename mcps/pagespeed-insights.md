# PageSpeed Insights

This MCP provides seamless integration with Google's PageSpeed Insights API, enabling developers to programmatically analyze web page performance metrics and receive actionable optimization recommendations. It allows for automated performance testing across multiple URLs, tracking Core Web Vitals scores, and identifying bottlenecks that impact user experience.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can incorporate performance monitoring directly into their development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and quality assurance processes. It supports both lab and field data analysis, helping teams prioritize optimizations based on real user metrics and lab simulations. This enables data-driven decisions to improve loading speed, reduce bounce rates, and enhance overall user satisfaction across web applications.
