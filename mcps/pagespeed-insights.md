This MCP connects smoothly with Google's PageSpeed Insights API. This feature lets developers analyze web page performance metrics programmatically and receive helpful optimization tips.

It also automates performance testing for multiple URLs, tracking Core Web Vitals scores while pinpointing bottlenecks that can affect user experience.

Using this MCP, developers can seamlessly integrate performance monitoring into their development workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and quality assurance processes.

It offers both lab and field data analysis. This combination helps teams focus on optimizations based on actual user metrics and lab simulations. With this approach, teams can make informed decisions to boost loading speed, lower bounce rates, and improve overall user satisfaction for their web applications.
