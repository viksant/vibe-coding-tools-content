# Memory Manager

The Memory Manager MCP provides a centralized system for managing and switching between different memory paths, enabling developers to maintain organized context across multiple AI projects and sessions. It allows for seamless transitions between different project contexts, ensuring that each AI interaction has access to the relevant historical data and conversation history without contamination from unrelated projects.

This tool is particularly valuable for teams working on multiple AI applications simultaneously, as it prevents context bleed and maintains project isolation. Developers can efficiently switch between different memory contexts, improving workflow organization and reducing the cognitive overhead of managing multiple AI project histories. The Memory Manager supports both individual developers and collaborative teams in maintaining clean, project-specific context management.
