The PlanetScale MCP makes it easy for AI assistants to interact securely with PlanetScale's serverless database platform. It does this through authenticated API connections.

With this MCP, developers gain programmatic access to database resources. They can list organizations, databases, and branches, and run SQL queries while ensuring proper authentication and security.

This integration opens up new possibilities for developers. They can create AI-driven workflows for database management, automate routine tasks, and even enable natural language querying of their PlanetScale databases.

The MCP also supports secure authentication methods and adheres to PlanetScale's API guidelines. This makes it a great choice for building smart database assistants, automated testing tools, and applications for data analysis that need direct access to databases.
