The PlanetScale MCP enables AI assistants to securely interact with PlanetScale's serverless database platform through authenticated API connections. 

This MCP provides programmatic access to database resources, allowing AI tools to list organizations, databases, and branches, as well as execute SQL queries with proper authentication and security controls.

Developers can leverage this integration to build AI-powered database management workflows, automate routine database operations, and enable natural language querying of their PlanetScale databases. 

The MCP supports secure authentication mechanisms and follows PlanetScale's API best practices, making it ideal for building intelligent database assistants, automated testing tools, and data analysis applications that require direct database access.
