# Excalidraw

This MCP enables developers to programmatically create, edit, and manage Excalidraw diagrams through conversational interfaces. It provides comprehensive tools for generating visual content including shapes, text, arrows, and freehand drawings, with capabilities to update existing diagrams, export them in various formats (PNG, SVG), and store them for later retrieval. This transforms how developers approach documentation, system design, and collaborative planning by bringing visual diagramming directly into their workflow.

The integration supports real-time collaboration features and version management, making it ideal for technical documentation, architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframing. Developers can automate diagram creation as part of CI/CD pipelines, generate visual explanations during code reviews, or maintain living documentation that stays synchronized with codebase changes. This bridges the gap between textual conversations and visual communication, enhancing clarity in technical discussions.
