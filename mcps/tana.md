# Tana

This MCP provides seamless integration with Tana's Input API, enabling developers to programmatically create, update, and manage structured data within Tana workspaces. It transforms Tana from a personal note-taking tool into a powerful platform for automated data workflows, allowing for real-time synchronization between external systems and Tana's flexible node-based structure.

Developers can leverage this integration to build automated data ingestion pipelines, sync information from databases or APIs, and create intelligent note-taking assistants. The MCP supports complex data manipulation operations, making it ideal for knowledge management systems, research automation, and collaborative workspace management where structured data needs to flow efficiently between Tana and other tools.
