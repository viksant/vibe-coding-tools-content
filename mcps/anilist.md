# AniList

The AniList MCP server provides direct access to AniList's extensive API, enabling AI assistants to query and interact with one of the most comprehensive anime and manga databases available. This integration allows developers to build AI-powered tools that can search for anime series, manga titles, character information, user reviews, and community ratings through natural language queries.

This server is particularly useful for developers creating entertainment applications, recommendation systems, or content discovery tools that leverage anime and manga data. It provides structured access to detailed metadata including episode information, studio details, voice actors, and user ratings. The MCP server handles authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization, making it easy for AI systems to consume and process anime-related information for various applications from content recommendation to fan community tools.
