# Memory LibSQL

Memory LibSQL provides a robust persistent memory solution for Model Context Protocol (MCP) applications, leveraging libSQL's high-performance SQL database engine. This MCP enables AI agents and language models to maintain state across sessions, store conversation history, cache expensive computations, and persist user preferences with ACID guarantees. Unlike ephemeral memory systems, Memory LibSQL ensures data durability while maintaining low-latency access crucial for real-time AI interactions.

Developers can build sophisticated stateful applications like personalized AI assistants that remember user context, multi-step workflow tools that maintain progress, and analytics systems that track model performance over time. The integration with libSQL provides SQLite compatibility with enhanced scalability features, making it suitable for both development and production deployments. This persistence layer transforms MCP from a stateless protocol into a powerful platform for building intelligent applications that learn and adapt based on historical interactions.
