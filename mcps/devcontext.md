# DevContext

DevContext is a sophisticated context management system that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with advanced retrieval capabilities. It provides developers with intelligent context awareness by understanding codebases, conversations, and development patterns to deliver relevant information precisely when needed. The system enhances development workflows by automatically surfacing appropriate context, reducing cognitive load, and improving productivity through smart pattern recognition and contextual understanding.
