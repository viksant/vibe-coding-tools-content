DevContext is an advanced context management system that follows the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and features powerful retrieval capabilities.

It helps developers by offering intelligent context awareness. This means it understands codebases, conversations, and development patterns, allowing it to provide the right information exactly when you need it.

By automatically highlighting relevant context, the system streamlines development workflows. It reduces mental strain and boosts productivity through smart pattern recognition and contextual insights.
