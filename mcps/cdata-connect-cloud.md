# CData Connect Cloud

This MCP integrates with CData Connect Cloud to provide a unified SQL interface for querying diverse data sources including cloud applications, databases, and APIs. Developers can write standard SQL queries that automatically translate to native API calls and database queries, eliminating the need for custom connectors and complex integration code. This enables seamless data access across platforms like Salesforce, Shopify, BigQuery, and SQL Server without learning multiple query languages or dealing with API rate limits.

The MCP facilitates real-time data integration for analytics dashboards, automated workflows, and business intelligence applications. By abstracting away the complexities of disparate data sources, it accelerates development of data-driven applications and simplifies ETL processes. Common use cases include building unified reporting systems, synchronizing data across business applications, and creating custom analytics pipelines that combine data from multiple sources with minimal setup overhead.
