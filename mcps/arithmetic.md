The Arithmetic MCP provides a standardized interface for performing fundamental mathematical calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations. This enables developers to integrate reliable arithmetic capabilities directly into their workflows without needing to implement custom calculation logic. 

The MCP handles edge cases and error conditions, ensuring consistent and predictable results across different applications.

By abstracting basic mathematical operations into a reusable service, this MCP simplifies the development of financial applications, data processing pipelines, scientific calculations, and any workflow requiring numeric computations. 

It supports both integer and floating-point arithmetic, making it versatile for various use cases from simple budget calculations to complex algorithmic processing. The standardized API ensures interoperability across different systems while maintaining computational accuracy and performance.
