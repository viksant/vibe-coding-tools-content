# Outlook for macOS

This MCP server enables seamless integration with Microsoft Outlook for macOS through AppleScript automation. It provides developers with programmatic access to Outlook's core functionality, allowing them to automate email operations (sending, reading, organizing), calendar management (scheduling events, checking availability), and contact handling (searching, updating records). This automation capability is particularly valuable for building workflow tools, scheduling assistants, and productivity applications that require interaction with email and calendar systems.

Developers can leverage this MCP to create sophisticated automation scripts that handle routine tasks like sending automated notifications, managing meeting schedules, or processing incoming emails. The integration supports both personal productivity applications and enterprise workflow solutions, making it ideal for building custom scheduling assistants, automated reporting systems, or contact management tools that need to interact directly with Outlook's native macOS interface.
