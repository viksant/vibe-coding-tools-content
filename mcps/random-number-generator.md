# Random Number Generator

This MCP provides robust random number generation capabilities that enable developers to create realistic simulations, implement game mechanics, and perform statistical sampling. It supports generating both integers and floating-point numbers within user-defined ranges, ensuring flexibility for various computational needs. The tool is particularly valuable for applications requiring unpredictability or probabilistic modeling.

With this MCP, developers can enhance applications by incorporating random elements for testing, randomization algorithms, or Monte Carlo simulations. It simplifies the process of generating high-quality random numbers without requiring low-level implementation details, making it accessible for prototyping and production use cases across different domains.
