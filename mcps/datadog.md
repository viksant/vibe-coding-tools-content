# Datadog

The Datadog MCP provides seamless integration with Datadog's comprehensive monitoring platform, allowing developers to programmatically access and manage incident data. This integration enables real-time incident listing, detailed incident retrieval, and streamlined observability workflows directly within development environments. Developers can quickly assess system health, track incident timelines, and coordinate response efforts without switching between multiple tools.

By leveraging this MCP, teams can automate incident management processes, create custom monitoring dashboards, and integrate Datadog's powerful observability capabilities into their existing development workflows. This is particularly valuable for DevOps engineers and SRE teams who need to maintain system reliability, perform root cause analysis, and ensure continuous monitoring across distributed systems and microservices architectures.
