# Time and Timezone

This MCP provides robust time and timezone conversion capabilities that enable developers to work with accurate, localized time data across different regions. It supports retrieving current times and converting between timezones using standardized IANA timezone names, ensuring precision and reliability for global applications.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications that require time-sensitive operations across multiple timezones, such as scheduling systems, international event coordination, or real-time collaboration tools. The API handles daylight saving time adjustments and regional timezone rules automatically, eliminating the complexity of manual time calculations and ensuring consistent behavior across different geographical locations.
