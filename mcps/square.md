Developers can create smart commerce solutions that automate transactions, synchronize product catalogs, and generate valuable business insights using Square's strong API ecosystem.

This integration allows AI systems to oversee all aspects of e-commerce, from processing secure payments and managing refunds to tracking sales data and handling customer relationships.
