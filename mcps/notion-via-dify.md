This MCP server connects Claude with your Notion knowledge bases using the Dify API. This setup lets developers search for and retrieve documentation, code snippets, and project notes right in their coding workflow.

Now, you won’t have to jump between different applications. You can query Notion databases in real-time and get the documentation, API references, or internal knowledge you need while coding.

This integration provides easy access to well-organized Notion content. It supports complex queries across various databases and pages, making it simple to find exactly what you're looking for.

Developers can locate specific technical documentation, team guidelines, or project specifications without stepping out of their development environment. 

This approach smooths out the coding process, cuts down on interruptions, and ensures developers can access the latest information stored in Notion. It’s perfect for teams that keep their documentation and knowledge bases in Notion.
