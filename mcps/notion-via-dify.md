# Notion (via Dify)

This MCP server connects Claude to your Notion knowledge bases through the Dify API, allowing developers to search and retrieve documentation, code snippets, and project notes directly within their coding workflow. Instead of context-switching between applications, you can query Notion databases in real-time to access relevant documentation, API references, or internal knowledge while writing code.

The integration enables seamless access to organized Notion content, supporting complex queries across multiple databases and pages. Developers can quickly find specific technical documentation, team guidelines, or project specifications without leaving their development environment. This streamlines the coding process, reduces interruptions, and ensures developers have immediate access to the most up-to-date information stored in Notion, making it ideal for teams that maintain their documentation and knowledge bases in Notion.
