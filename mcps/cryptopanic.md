# CryptoPanic

This MCP server integrates with the CryptoPanic API to deliver real-time cryptocurrency news, market analysis, and video content directly into your development workflow. It provides configurable pagination and filtering options, allowing developers to access specific news feeds based on cryptocurrency pairs, regions, or importance levels. The integration enables automated monitoring of market sentiment and breaking news that could impact trading strategies.

Developers can build applications that leverage real-time crypto news for algorithmic trading systems, portfolio management tools, and market analysis dashboards. The MCP supports financial analysis by providing structured news data that can be processed for sentiment analysis, trend identification, and investment decision support.
