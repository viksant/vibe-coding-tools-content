This MCP server connects with the CryptoPanic API to bring you real-time cryptocurrency news, market insights, and video content right into your development workflow. 

You can customize pagination and filtering options, making it easy for developers to pull specific news feeds based on cryptocurrency pairs, regions, or levels of importance. This integration allows for automated tracking of market sentiment and breaking news that might influence trading strategies.

Developers can create applications that tap into real-time crypto news for algorithmic trading systems, portfolio management tools, and market analysis dashboards. 

The MCP also enhances financial analysis by offering structured news data that supports sentiment analysis, trend identification, and investment decision-making. This feature is especially useful for building automated trading bots, risk management systems, and research platforms that need the latest cryptocurrency market insights.
