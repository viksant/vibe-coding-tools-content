# Google Maps (Travel Planner)

This MCP provides a powerful interface to Google Maps APIs, allowing AI systems to automate complex travel planning tasks. Developers can leverage this integration to build applications that generate optimized itineraries, calculate efficient routes between multiple destinations, and provide real-time location-based services. The MCP handles the complexities of Google Maps integration, including geocoding, directions, place details, and distance matrix calculations.

By abstracting the Google Maps API complexity, this MCP enables developers to focus on building sophisticated travel planning features without deep expertise in mapping services. Use cases include automated trip planners that optimize for time, distance, or user preferences; location-aware applications that provide contextual recommendations; and travel management systems that can dynamically adjust itineraries based on real-time conditions like traffic or weather.
