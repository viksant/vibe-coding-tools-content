# Vilnius Transport

The Vilnius Transport MCP integrates with official public transport data sources in Vilnius, Lithuania, providing developers with real-time access to transit schedules, vehicle locations, and route information. This enables the creation of applications that can answer queries about bus and trolleybus arrivals, plan optimal journeys, and provide up-to-the-minute service alerts. Developers can build intelligent transportation assistants, travel planning tools, and real-time transit dashboards that help residents and visitors navigate the city efficiently.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can create solutions that reduce wait times, improve travel predictability, and enhance the overall public transport experience. The API provides structured data about routes, stops, and vehicle movements, making it ideal for building chatbots, mobile apps, or web services that require accurate, current transit information. This is particularly valuable for tourism applications, daily commuter tools, and urban mobility platforms seeking to integrate Vilnius public transport data seamlessly.
