The Vilnius Transport MCP connects directly with official public transport data sources in Vilnius, Lithuania. This setup gives developers real-time access to transit schedules, vehicle locations, and route details.

With this information at their fingertips, developers can create apps that answer questions about bus and trolleybus arrivals, help users plan the best journeys, and send out the latest service alerts. Imagine intelligent transportation assistants, travel planning tools, and real-time transit dashboards that make it easier for both residents and visitors to get around the city.

Using this MCP, developers can design solutions that cut down on wait times, make travel more predictable, and improve the overall experience of using public transport. 

The API offers structured data about routes, stops, and vehicle movements. This makes it perfect for building chatbots, mobile apps, or web services that need accurate and timely transit information. Itâ€™s especially useful for tourism apps, daily commuter tools, and urban mobility platforms looking to incorporate Vilnius public transport data smoothly.
