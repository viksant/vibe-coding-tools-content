# Nile

Nile MCP provides comprehensive database management capabilities for Postgres environments, enabling AI assistants to directly interact with your database infrastructure. It streamlines customer and user management workflows while offering built-in B2B authentication setup through natural language commands. Developers can leverage LLMs to execute complex queries, manage database schemas, and implement secure authentication patterns without writing manual SQL or authentication code, significantly accelerating development cycles for data-intensive applications.
