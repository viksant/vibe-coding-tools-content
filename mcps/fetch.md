# Fetch

Fetch is a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI assistants to access and process web content by converting HTML pages into clean markdown format. This transformation makes web content more digestible for large language models, allowing them to efficiently analyze and reason about information from websites, documentation, and online resources.

Developers can use Fetch to build AI applications that need real-time web data access, content summarization, or information extraction from web pages. The markdown conversion preserves essential structure while removing unnecessary HTML clutter, improving the quality of context provided to LLMs for more accurate responses and analysis.
