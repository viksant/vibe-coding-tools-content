# RoCQ

RoCQ MCP bridges the gap between natural language and formal verification by enabling developers to interact with the Coq proof assistant using conversational inputs. This allows for automated dependent type checking, inductive type definition, and property proving without requiring deep expertise in Coq's formal syntax. Developers can describe mathematical properties, program specifications, or logical constraints in plain English, and RoCQ translates these into precise Coq definitions and proof scripts.

The tool significantly lowers the barrier to entry for formal methods, making theorem proving accessible for software verification, security analysis, and correctness proofs. It supports use cases ranging from verifying algorithm correctness to ensuring security properties in smart contracts. By automating the translation from intuitive descriptions to rigorous formal proofs, RoCQ accelerates adoption of formal verification in mainstream software development while maintaining mathematical precision.
