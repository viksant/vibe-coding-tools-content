# Literature Memory

This MCP bridges academic literature management systems with knowledge graph technology, enabling researchers to organize, analyze, and connect scholarly sources with unprecedented efficiency. It transforms static PDFs and reference collections into dynamic, interconnected knowledge networks where entities, concepts, and citations become first-class objects that can be queried, visualized, and traversed.

Researchers can automatically extract and link entities across papers, create semantic relationships between concepts, and maintain contextual notes that persist across the literature graph. This enables powerful use cases like tracking concept evolution through citation networks, discovering unexpected connections between disparate research areas, and maintaining coherent knowledge structures that scale across thousands of papers. The system supports both individual research workflows and collaborative academic projects where multiple researchers need to share and build upon interconnected knowledge bases.
