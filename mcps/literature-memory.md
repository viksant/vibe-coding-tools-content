This MCP connects academic literature management systems with knowledge graph technology. It helps researchers organize, analyze, and link scholarly sources more effectively than ever before.

Imagine turning static PDFs and reference collections into lively, interconnected knowledge networks. In this setup, entities, concepts, and citations become key elements that you can query, visualize, and explore.

With this system, researchers can automatically identify and connect entities across different papers. They can also create meaningful relationships between concepts and keep notes that stay relevant throughout the literature graph.

This opens up exciting possibilities, like tracking how concepts evolve through citation networks, uncovering surprising links between different research fields, and maintaining clear knowledge structures that work well even with thousands of papers.

The system caters to both individual research workflows and collaborative academic projects, making it easy for multiple researchers to share and build on interconnected knowledge bases.
