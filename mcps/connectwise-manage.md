# ConnectWise Manage

The ConnectWise Manage MCP enables managed service providers and IT professionals to interact directly with their ConnectWise Manage instance through a seamless API integration. This tool allows users to access critical business data including service tickets, company records, and contact information without leaving their current workflow environment. Developers can programmatically retrieve ticket details, update statuses, manage client information, and synchronize data across systems.

This integration significantly improves operational efficiency by eliminating context switching between different applications. MSP teams can build custom workflows, automate routine tasks like ticket creation and updates, and maintain real-time synchronization between ConnectWise Manage and other business tools. The MCP supports comprehensive service management operations, from initial client engagement through ticket resolution and reporting.
