# Mistral OCR

Mistral OCR MCP enables developers to integrate optical character recognition capabilities into their applications using Mistral AI's powerful OCR API. This tool processes various document formats including images and PDFs, extracting readable text content with high accuracy. It supports both local file uploads and remote URLs, making it versatile for different use cases such as document digitization, data extraction from scanned forms, or processing user-uploaded content.

The MCP is Docker containerized for simplified deployment and scalability, allowing seamless integration into existing workflows. Developers can leverage this for automating document processing pipelines, building intelligent content management systems, or enhancing applications with text extraction features. It's particularly valuable for handling large volumes of documents, reducing manual data entry, and enabling search functionality across visual content.
