Screeny is a unique MCP server crafted just for macOS. It allows AI assistants to take screenshots of specific application windows while keeping your privacy firmly in check.

Here’s how it works: Unlike regular screenshot tools that can grab content from any window or screen, Screeny uses a clear approval process. Users must give permission for each window during the initial setup. This way, only the applications that you authorize can be captured, keeping your sensitive information safe from prying eyes.

This server also gives developers a secure way to add screenshot features to their AI workflows. Think about applications for automated testing, generating documentation, or helping users navigate through tasks.

With its detailed permission settings, Screeny supports various use cases. You can monitor specific application states, create visual documentation, and provide contextual help—all without jeopardizing user privacy. This makes it perfect for development tools, support systems, and any application that needs controlled visual access to macOS windows.
