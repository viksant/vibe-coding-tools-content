Screeny is a specialized MCP server designed for macOS that enables AI assistants to capture screenshots of specific application windows while maintaining strict privacy controls. 

Unlike traditional screenshot tools that can access any window or screen content, Screeny operates on an explicit approval model where users must grant permission for each individual window during initial setup. This ensures that only pre-authorized applications can be captured, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

The server provides developers with a secure way to integrate screenshot capabilities into AI workflows for applications like automated testing, documentation generation, and user assistance scenarios. 

By enforcing granular permission controls, Screeny enables use cases such as monitoring specific application states, creating visual documentation, and providing contextual help without compromising user privacy. This makes it ideal for development tools, support systems, and any application requiring controlled visual access to macOS windows.
