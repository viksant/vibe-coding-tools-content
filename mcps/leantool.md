# LeanTool

LeanTool is an MCP server that bridges the gap between large language models and the Lean 4 programming language/environment. It provides a direct communication channel that allows LLMs to interact with Lean's code interpreter, enabling real-time syntax validation and error feedback. This is particularly valuable given Lean 4's rapidly evolving syntax and library ecosystem, which often outpaces LLM training data.

By giving LLMs the ability to test and refine their Lean code through iterative execution, LeanTool dramatically improves code correctness and reduces manual debugging. Developers can use this for automated theorem proving assistance, educational tool creation, and reliable code generation in formal verification workflows. The tool essentially provides a 'code interpreter' pattern specifically tailored for interactive theorem proving with Lean 4.
