This MCP works smoothly with Safari on macOS, allowing you to easily capture high-quality screenshots of web pages.

Developers can streamline their visual testing by automatically taking screenshots across various viewports, devices, and states. This helps in spotting UI regressions and visual bugs quickly. Plus, the tool is a great fit for web archiving. It lets you systematically capture web content for documentation, compliance, or historical preservation.

But there's more! This MCP offers advanced features like capturing full-page screenshots, specific DOM elements, or even multiple pages in a row.

It also plays well with CI/CD pipelines, making automated visual regression testing a breeze. With its ability to compare against baseline images, you can skip the manual screenshot process. This ensures that your visual testing for web applications and websites is both reliable and repeatable.
