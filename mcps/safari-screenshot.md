# Safari Screenshot

This MCP provides seamless integration with Safari on macOS to programmatically capture high-quality screenshots of web pages. Developers can automate visual testing workflows by capturing screenshots across different viewports, devices, and states to detect UI regressions and visual bugs. The tool supports web archiving use cases by enabling systematic capture of web content for documentation, compliance, or historical preservation.

Beyond basic screenshot capture, this MCP enables advanced workflows like capturing full-page screenshots, specific DOM elements, or multiple pages in sequence. It integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated visual regression testing and supports comparison against baseline images. This eliminates manual screenshot processes and provides reliable, repeatable visual testing capabilities for web applications and websites.
