# Stealth Browser

The Stealth Browser MCP provides advanced browser automation capabilities specifically designed to bypass sophisticated bot detection systems. By leveraging Playwright's powerful automation framework combined with anti-detection techniques, this MCP enables developers to perform web scraping and automated testing on websites that employ advanced protection mechanisms. It mimics human-like browsing behavior, manages browser fingerprints, and handles various detection evasion strategies.

This MCP is particularly valuable for data extraction from protected websites, quality assurance testing of security implementations, and monitoring competitive intelligence. Developers can automate interactions with complex web applications that would otherwise block traditional scraping tools, ensuring reliable data collection while maintaining compliance with reasonable usage policies. The solution supports headless and headed browser modes, allowing for both automated background operations and visual debugging when needed.
