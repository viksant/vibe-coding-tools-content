The Stealth Browser MCP offers powerful browser automation features that help you navigate around advanced bot detection systems.

It uses Playwright's robust automation framework along with anti-detection techniques. This combination allows developers to scrape and test websites that have strong protective measures in place. The MCP mimics human browsing behavior, manages browser fingerprints, and uses various strategies to evade detection.

This tool is especially useful for extracting data from secured sites, testing security implementations, and keeping an eye on competitors.

With the MCP, developers can automate interactions with complex web applications that might block standard scraping tools. This ensures you can collect data reliably while sticking to reasonable usage policies.

Plus, the solution supports both headless and headed browser modes. That means you can run automated tasks in the background or visually debug when necessary.
