# Steam Web API

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Steam Web API, enabling developers to access comprehensive gaming data from the Steam platform. It allows querying of user game libraries, playtime statistics, achievement progress, and player profile information through standardized API calls.

Developers can build applications that analyze gaming habits, create personalized game recommendations, track achievement progress, or integrate Steam data into gaming communities and analytics platforms. The MCP handles authentication and API rate limiting, making it easy to incorporate rich Steam gaming data into web applications, mobile apps, or gaming dashboards.
