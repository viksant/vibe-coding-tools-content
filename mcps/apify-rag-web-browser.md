# Apify RAG Web Browser

This MCP enables developers to programmatically perform web searches and extract clean, structured content from web pages using Apify's RAG Web Browser Actor. It handles the complexities of web scraping, including JavaScript rendering, anti-bot detection, and content cleaning, providing reliable access to web data for various applications.

Developers can use this integration to build RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines, automate data collection for research, monitor web content changes, or feed fresh information into AI applications. The MCP abstracts away the infrastructure management, allowing teams to focus on building intelligent applications that leverage real-time web data without dealing with scraping challenges.
