# YouTube Transcript Extractor

The YouTube Transcript Extractor MCP provides developers with a streamlined API to programmatically retrieve full text transcripts from YouTube videos. By simply providing a video URL, developers can access structured transcript data including timestamps and speaker information when available. This eliminates the need for manual transcription or watching entire videos, saving significant time and effort.

This tool enables powerful content analysis workflows such as automated summarization, keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, and content categorization. Developers can build applications for market research, educational content processing, accessibility features, and media monitoring. The extracted transcripts serve as clean text data that can be integrated into NLP pipelines, search systems, and data analytics platforms for deeper insights into video content.
