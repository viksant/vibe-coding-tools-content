# Azure DevOps

This MCP provides a seamless integration with Azure DevOps, allowing AI agents to directly interact with your project management ecosystem. It enables automated management of work items, wikis, and project tasks, facilitating AI-driven planning, progress tracking, and cross-service workflow automation. Developers can leverage this integration to streamline project coordination, reduce manual overhead, and maintain real-time synchronization across development activities.

The MCP supports comprehensive project lifecycle management by connecting AI capabilities with Azure DevOps services. This enables intelligent task assignment, automated documentation updates, and coordinated release planning. By bridging AI reasoning with Azure DevOps' robust project management tools, teams can achieve higher efficiency, better visibility into project status, and more responsive adaptation to changing requirements throughout the development process.
