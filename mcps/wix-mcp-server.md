# Wix MCP Server

The Wix MCP Server enables developers to integrate Wix's comprehensive business platform with AI-powered tools through natural language prompts. This MCP provides programmatic access to Wix's ecosystem, allowing for seamless automation of business operations, content management, and e-commerce functionality.

Developers can build custom experiences on top of Wix by leveraging this MCP to create AI-driven applications that interact with Wix sites, manage online stores, handle bookings, and automate business workflows. The server bridges the gap between Wix's no-code platform and advanced AI capabilities, enabling sophisticated automation while maintaining the ease of use that Wix is known for. This is particularly valuable for businesses looking to enhance their Wix-based operations with intelligent automation and custom integrations.
