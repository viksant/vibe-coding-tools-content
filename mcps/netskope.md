# Netskope

The Netskope MCP provides a comprehensive interface to the Netskope API, enabling developers to programmatically manage their Netskope Private Access infrastructure. This integration allows for full automation of publisher lifecycle operations, application configuration management, security policy creation and enforcement, as well as detailed traffic diagnostics and monitoring capabilities. By exposing these functionalities through a standardized MCP interface, developers can build sophisticated automation workflows, integrate Netskope management into their existing DevOps pipelines, and create custom monitoring solutions.

This MCP is particularly valuable for organizations implementing Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) architectures, as it enables infrastructure-as-code approaches to security policy management. Use cases include automated onboarding of new applications to the private access platform, dynamic policy adjustments based on real-time security requirements, and comprehensive auditing of traffic flows for compliance and troubleshooting purposes. The MCP abstracts the complexity of direct API interactions, providing a developer-friendly way to incorporate Netskope's security capabilities into broader automation frameworks.
