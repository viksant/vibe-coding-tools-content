# Memory Plugin (SQLite)

The Memory Plugin (SQLite) MCP provides robust persistent storage capabilities using SQLite as its underlying database engine. This enables AI assistants and conversational agents to maintain context, store historical interactions, and recall information across multiple sessions. By leveraging SQLite's reliability and performance, the plugin ensures data persistence while remaining lightweight and easy to integrate.

Developers can use this MCP to build applications that require long-term memory capabilities, such as personalized AI assistants that remember user preferences, context-aware chatbots that maintain conversation history, or knowledge management systems that accumulate and retrieve information over time. The SQLite backend provides ACID compliance and efficient querying, making it suitable for production applications that need reliable data persistence without the overhead of larger database systems.
