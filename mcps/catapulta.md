Catapulta serves as an MCP server that makes deploying and managing smart contracts across the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem a breeze.

With Catapulta, developers can connect to more than 20 EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Ethereum, Base, and Monad, all from one convenient interface. This approach removes the hassle of juggling various RPC endpoints, gas tokens, and tools specific to each chain.

Whatâ€™s great about Catapulta is that it simplifies the multi-chain deployment process. Even teams lacking extensive blockchain knowledge can easily navigate it.

One of Catapulta's standout features is that it eliminates the need for native cryptocurrencies to pay transaction fees. Instead, it offers alternative methods for covering gas costs, potentially through account abstraction or gas sponsorship. This change makes it easier for both developers and users to get started.

This feature shines particularly for dApp developers who create cross-chain applications, DevOps teams handling smart contract deployments, and organizations testing blockchain on a large scale across various networks. They can do all this without the hassle of managing multiple wallets funded with different native tokens.
