# Catapulta

Catapulta is an MCP server that simplifies smart contract deployment and management across the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. It enables developers to interact with over 20 EVM-compatible blockchains—including Ethereum, Base, and Monad—using a unified interface, eliminating the complexity of managing different RPC endpoints, gas tokens, and chain-specific tooling. This streamlines the multi-chain deployment process, making it accessible even for teams without deep blockchain infrastructure expertise.

A key innovation is that Catapulta abstracts away the need for native cryptocurrencies to pay transaction fees. Instead, it supports alternative gas payment methods, likely through account abstraction or gas sponsorship, lowering the barrier to entry for developers and users. This is particularly valuable for dApp developers building cross-chain applications, DevOps teams managing smart contract deployments, and organizations conducting large-scale blockchain testing across multiple networks without the operational overhead of funding numerous wallets with different native tokens.
