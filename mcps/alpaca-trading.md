# Alpaca Trading

The Alpaca Trading MCP provides developers with a powerful interface to build and manage automated trading systems and investment applications. It offers comprehensive access to account information, real-time market data, order execution, and position tracking through Alpaca's commission-free trading API. This enables developers to create sophisticated trading algorithms, portfolio management tools, and financial analytics platforms.

With this MCP, developers can automate trading strategies, monitor portfolio performance, and execute trades programmatically across stocks and cryptocurrencies. It supports both paper trading for testing and live trading environments, making it ideal for building robo-advisors, quantitative trading systems, and personal finance applications. The integration simplifies complex financial operations while maintaining security and compliance with brokerage standards.
