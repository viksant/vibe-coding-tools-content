# SQL Server Express

This MCP provides seamless integration with Microsoft SQL Server Express, allowing developers to perform comprehensive database operations directly through the Model Context Protocol. It supports executing SQL queries, creating and modifying tables, describing database schemas, and managing data with full configurable authentication support including Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.

The tool enables developers to build, test, and maintain SQL Server Express databases efficiently, supporting development workflows that require reliable local database instances. It's particularly valuable for prototyping, testing database-driven applications, and learning SQL Server concepts without the overhead of enterprise licensing, making it ideal for small-scale applications and development environments.
