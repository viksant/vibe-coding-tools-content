This MCP connects smoothly with Microsoft SQL Server Express, letting developers handle a variety of database tasks right through the Model Context Protocol. 

You can run SQL queries, create and modify tables, describe database schemas, and manage data. Plus, it offers full configurable authentication options, including both Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.

With this tool, developers can easily build, test, and maintain SQL Server Express databases. It fits perfectly into development workflows that need reliable local database instances. 

This MCP shines when it comes to prototyping, testing database-driven applications, and learning SQL Server conceptsâ€”all without the burden of enterprise licensing. It's a great choice for small-scale applications and development environments.
