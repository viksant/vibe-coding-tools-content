Conductor Tasks is an open-source task management system designed to fit right into the way developers work. You can easily integrate it into your development setup, whether you’re using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or the Command Line Interface (CLI). 

So, what does it do? It helps teams take a closer look at product requirement documents (PRDs) and break down complex features into manageable steps. Plus, it offers smart coding assistance throughout the development process, making it a handy companion for developers. Conductor Tasks works with several large language models, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, Gemini, and xAI. This variety gives developers the freedom to choose their preferred AI provider.

One of the cool features of Conductor Tasks is its built-in terminal visualizations. You’ll find Kanban boards and tree diagrams that help you clearly see your project’s progress and understand task dependencies. 

With these tools, you can plan projects more effectively, lighten the mental load during development, and maintain a consistent quality of implementation across teams. Thanks to the MCP integration, you can access everything directly in your development environment without the hassle of switching contexts.
