# Conductor Tasks

Conductor Tasks is an open-source AI-powered task management system that integrates directly into developer workflows through MCP for IDEs or CLI. It helps teams analyze product requirement documents (PRDs), break down complex features into detailed implementation steps, and provides intelligent coding assistance throughout the development process. The tool supports multiple large language models including Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, Gemini, and xAI, giving developers flexibility in AI provider selection.

With built-in terminal visualizations like Kanban boards and tree diagrams, Conductor Tasks provides clear visibility into project progress and task dependencies. This enables more efficient project planning, reduces cognitive load during development, and ensures consistent implementation quality across teams. The MCP integration makes it seamlessly accessible within development environments without context switching.
