# Semgrep

This MCP brings Semgrep's powerful static analysis capabilities directly into development environments, enabling automated code scanning and security checks throughout the development lifecycle. It allows developers to identify vulnerabilities, bugs, and code quality issues early by scanning code against thousands of predefined security rules and custom patterns. The integration supports real-time feedback during coding sessions and can be incorporated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security assessment.

By embedding Semgrep's analysis directly into development workflows, this MCP helps teams maintain secure coding practices without disrupting their existing processes. It enables automated scanning for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, and insecure dependencies while supporting custom rule creation for organization-specific security requirements. The tool provides actionable findings with precise code locations, making it easy for developers to quickly address security issues before they reach production.
