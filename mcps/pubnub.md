# PubNub

The PubNub Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server integrates PubNub's comprehensive SDK documentation and API resources directly into LLM-powered development environments like Cursor IDE. This enables AI assistants to understand PubNub's real-time communication APIs, SDK methods, and best practices, allowing developers to get accurate code suggestions and implementation guidance for building real-time features.

By exposing PubNub's extensive documentation and API specifications, this MCP server helps developers build applications with real-time messaging, presence detection, and data streaming capabilities. It supports use cases ranging from chat applications and live collaboration tools to IoT device management and real-time dashboards, significantly reducing development time and improving code quality through AI-assisted development workflows.
