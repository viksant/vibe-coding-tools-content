This MCP provides specialized access to the Deepseek R1 model's reasoning capabilities, enabling developers to extract and analyze the step-by-step reasoning chains the model uses to solve complex problems. 

By exposing these internal thought processes, it transforms black-box AI into transparent, explainable systems that can be audited, debugged, and trusted for critical applications.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications requiring verifiable logic, such as automated code review systems, educational tutors that show their work, or compliance tools that must justify their decisions. 

The extracted reasoning chains serve as a powerful debugging tool for AI behavior and provide the foundation for building more reliable and interpretable AI-powered features.
