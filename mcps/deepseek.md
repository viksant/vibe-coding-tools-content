This MCP unlocks the reasoning capabilities of the Deepseek R1 model, allowing developers to see how the model tackles complex problems step by step.

Instead of treating AI like a mysterious black box, this approach makes its internal thought processes clear and understandable. This transparency means we can audit, debug, and trust these systems for important tasks.

Developers can use this MCP to create applications that need clear logic, such as automated code review tools, educational tutors that explain their solutions, or compliance tools that need to justify their decisions. 

The reasoning chains extracted from the model become a handy debugging tool for understanding AI behavior. They also lay the groundwork for building more reliable and interpretable AI features.
