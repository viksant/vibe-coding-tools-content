# Asset Price MCP

The Asset Price MCP provides developers with a streamlined API to access real-time pricing data for various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as precious metals such as gold and silver. This server acts as a reliable data bridge, ensuring that large language models and AI applications can retrieve accurate, up-to-date financial information without dealing with complex market data integrations.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build financial dashboards, trading bots, portfolio trackers, and AI-powered investment advisors. The service simplifies access to market data that would otherwise require multiple API integrations and rate limiting management, making it ideal for applications that need to display or analyze current asset valuations in real-time.
