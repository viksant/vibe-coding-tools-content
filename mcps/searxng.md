This MCP server brings together SearXNG, a metasearch engine that prioritizes user privacy. This setup allows language models to conduct thorough web searches while keeping user data safe.

What sets SearXNG apart from traditional search APIs is its ability to gather results from various sources without tracking or profiling users. This makes it perfect for applications that need unbiased information and respect privacy.

Developers can take advantage of customizable search parameters. They can choose from different categories like general, news, and images, set time ranges, and manage pagination controls to fine-tune the results.

With these features, you can create tools like real-time research assistants, content verification systems, and privacy-focused applications that require up-to-date web data. All of this happens without compromising user anonymity or hitting those pesky API rate limits.
