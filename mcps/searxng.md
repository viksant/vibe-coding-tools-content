# SearXNG

This MCP server integrates SearXNG, a privacy-respecting metasearch engine, allowing language models to perform comprehensive web searches while protecting user data. Unlike traditional search APIs, SearXNG aggregates results from multiple sources without tracking or profiling, making it ideal for applications requiring unbiased information retrieval and privacy compliance.

Developers can leverage customizable search parameters including categories (general, news, images), time ranges, and pagination controls to refine results. This enables use cases like real-time research assistants, content verification tools, and privacy-conscious applications that need current web data without compromising user anonymity or dealing with API rate limits.
