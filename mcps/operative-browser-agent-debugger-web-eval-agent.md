The Operative Browser Agent Debugger MCP server makes it easier to test web applications by automating the process for coding agents.

This handy tool can open browsers on its own, manage OAuth logins—like Google authentication—navigate through applications, and gather detailed debugging information, including console logs, network requests, and errors.

As it tests, the server automatically captures screenshots. This feature helps developers quickly pinpoint issues with web applications and verify that everything is working as it should, all without needing to do it manually. This automation speeds up the debugging process and enhances quality assurance efforts.
