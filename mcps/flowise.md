# Flowise

The Flowise MCP server provides a bridge between the Model Context Protocol and Flowise's visual low-code platform for building customized LLM workflows. This integration allows developers to programmatically interact with pre-built chatflows and AI assistants, enabling dynamic conversational AI capabilities within their applications. Developers can trigger complex multi-step workflows, manage conversation state, and process natural language inputs through a standardized MCP interface.

By leveraging this MCP server, teams can rapidly deploy AI-powered conversational interfaces without rebuilding complex logic from scratch. Use cases include customer support automation, internal knowledge bases, interactive documentation systems, and AI-assisted workflow guidance. The integration simplifies the process of incorporating sophisticated chat interfaces while maintaining the flexibility to customize Flowise components through visual editing and programmatic control.
