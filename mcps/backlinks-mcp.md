# Backlinks MCP

The Backlinks MCP server provides developers with programmatic access to Ahrefs' extensive backlink database, enabling SEO analysis and competitive research at scale. By exposing Ahrefs' robust link intelligence through a standardized MCP protocol, it allows applications to fetch detailed backlink profiles, including referring domains, anchor texts, and link quality metrics for any target URL or domain.

This MCP is particularly valuable for building SEO tools, content strategy platforms, and competitive analysis dashboards. Developers can integrate comprehensive backlink auditing directly into their workflows, automating tasks like monitoring link growth, identifying toxic backlinks, or analyzing competitors' link-building strategies without manual data exports or complex API integrations.
