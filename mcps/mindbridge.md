# MindBridge

MindBridge is an AI orchestration MCP server that provides developers with a unified API gateway to interact with multiple large language models including OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama, and other providers. This eliminates the complexity of managing different API endpoints, authentication methods, and response formats across various AI services.

Developers can use MindBridge to build sophisticated multi-LLM workflows such as intelligent query routing, model comparison and benchmarking, and obtaining second opinions from different AI systems. The server handles load balancing, failover strategies, and response normalization, making it easier to build resilient AI applications that leverage the strengths of different models while maintaining a consistent development experience across providers.
