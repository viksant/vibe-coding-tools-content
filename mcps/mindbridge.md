MindBridge acts as an AI orchestration server, offering developers a single API gateway to connect with various large language models like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Ollama, and more. This setup simplifies the process by removing the hassle of juggling multiple API endpoints, different authentication methods, and varying response formats that come with using different AI services.

With MindBridge, developers can create advanced workflows that involve multiple language models. For instance, they can route queries intelligently, compare models, and even seek second opinions from diverse AI systems.

The server takes care of load balancing, failover strategies, and normalizing responses. This functionality helps developers create resilient AI applications that tap into the unique strengths of different models while keeping the development experience smooth and consistent across various providers.
