# Make

This MCP server connects AI assistants directly to Make (formerly Integromat), allowing them to design, trigger, and monitor complex automation workflows. Developers can use natural language to create multi-step integrations that connect disparate systems like CRMs, databases, communication platforms, and cloud services without writing code. The MCP provides full access to Make's extensive library of app connectors and workflow management capabilities.

Key benefits include rapid prototyping of business automations, intelligent workflow optimization, and seamless integration across an organization's tech stack. Use cases range from automated data synchronization between business applications to intelligent alert systems that trigger based on specific conditions. This enables teams to delegate complex integration tasks to AI assistants while maintaining full visibility and control over automated processes.
