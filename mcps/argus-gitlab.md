# Argus (GitLab)

The Argus MCP for GitLab enables developers to automate security scanning and code quality assessments directly within their GitLab repositories. By providing repository analysis and file retrieval capabilities, it allows for continuous security monitoring and automated code reviews as part of CI/CD pipelines. This helps teams identify vulnerabilities early, maintain code quality standards, and streamline security compliance processes.

The MCP supports comprehensive DevOps workflows by integrating security assessments into development cycles without disrupting existing processes. Developers can use Argus to automatically scan pull requests, monitor for security issues in real-time, and retrieve specific files for detailed analysis. This enables proactive security management, reduces manual review overhead, and ensures that security becomes an integral part of the development lifecycle rather than an afterthought.
