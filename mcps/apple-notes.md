# Apple Notes

This MCP server enables developers to programmatically interact with their local Apple Notes databases, providing read and search capabilities for notes content. It allows you to query notes by title, content, or metadata, making it ideal for building tools that integrate with personal knowledge management systems or for automating note-related workflows.

Developers can use this MCP to create custom search interfaces, build note analysis tools, or integrate Apple Notes data with other applications. The server handles the underlying database access, providing a clean API for working with notes without requiring deep knowledge of Apple's internal storage format.
