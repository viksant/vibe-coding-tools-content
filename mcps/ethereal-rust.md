# Ethereal Rust

Ethereal Rust provides a comprehensive foundation for developing Rust applications with enterprise-grade features. It offers built-in tool management, authentication handling, and extensible middleware support, enabling developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure. The framework supports both stdio and Server-Sent Events (SSE) transports, making it suitable for various deployment scenarios from CLI tools to real-time web applications.

With its strong type safety guarantees and flexible architecture, Ethereal Rust is ideal for building reliable systems that require secure authentication, custom middleware pipelines, and efficient communication protocols. Developers can leverage this foundation to create everything from microservices and APIs to real-time data processing applications with confidence in their application's security and performance characteristics.
