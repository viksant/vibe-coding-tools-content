# RepoMix

RepoMix is a developer tool that intelligently packages complete codebases into consolidated single files optimized for AI consumption. It preserves critical code structure, relationships, and context while eliminating redundant tokens and unnecessary whitespace that typically burden AI models. The system maintains import dependencies, function hierarchies, and architectural patterns in a compressed format that retains semantic meaning.

This enables developers to efficiently feed entire projects to AI assistants for comprehensive analysis, refactoring, or documentation generation without hitting token limits. Use cases include migrating legacy codebases, generating technical documentation, performing large-scale refactoring, and enabling AI-powered code reviews across complete project ecosystems. By optimizing token usage while preserving code intelligence, RepoMix bridges the gap between complex multi-file repositories and AI model constraints.
