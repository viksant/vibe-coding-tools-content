This MCP connects smoothly with the Docling library, allowing developers to handle and analyze documents in multiple formats like PDF, DOCX, and images.

It comes with impressive features that let you convert documents into clean markdown, pull structured data from tables, and process images thanks to its built-in OCR support for text recognition. This means you can efficiently manage both structured and unstructured data from a variety of document sources.

Developers can use this MCP to create applications that focus on document intelligence. Think automated data extraction pipelines, content management systems, and document analysis tools.

With its OCR capabilities, you can extract text from scanned documents and images. Plus, when it comes to table extraction, it keeps the data structure intact for deeper analysis. This makes it perfect for areas like legal tech, financial document processing, research automation, and workflows for digitizing content.
