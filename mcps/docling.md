# Docling

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Docling library, enabling developers to process and analyze documents in various formats including PDF, DOCX, and images. It offers powerful capabilities such as converting documents to clean markdown, extracting structured data from tables, and handling images with built-in OCR support for text recognition. This allows for efficient processing of both structured and unstructured data from diverse document sources.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications that require document intelligence, such as automated data extraction pipelines, content management systems, and document analysis tools. The OCR capabilities enable text extraction from scanned documents and images, while table extraction preserves data structure for further analysis. This makes it ideal for use cases in legal tech, financial document processing, research automation, and content digitization workflows.
