It supports essential e-commerce functions such as creating and managing orders, processing payments, handling refunds, and managing subscriptions. This makes it ideal for building online stores, subscription services, and automated billing systems. The server abstracts the complexity of PayPal's API, offering a simplified interface for common financial operations.

By leveraging this MCP, developers can accelerate the development of secure and scalable financial features, ensuring PCI compliance and utilizing PayPal's global payment infrastructure. 

It is particularly beneficial for automating recurring billing, managing customer disputes, and synchronizing order data between an application and PayPal's ecosystem. This streamlines the entire transaction lifecycle for businesses of all sizes.
