# Pyodide Integration

This MCP integrates Pyodide, a WebAssembly-powered Python distribution that runs entirely in the browser, allowing developers to execute Python code directly within JavaScript environments. It bridges the gap between Python's rich data science ecosystem and web technologies, enabling complex computations, data analysis, and machine learning tasks to be performed client-side without server dependencies.

Developers can leverage popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn directly in web applications, creating interactive data visualization tools, scientific computing platforms, and educational environments. The integration supports bidirectional communication between Python and JavaScript, allowing seamless data exchange and function calls between both languages while maintaining security through browser sandboxing.
