# Monday.com

This MCP provides seamless integration with Monday.com's project management platform, allowing developers to automate and streamline team collaboration workflows. It enables programmatic creation of items, retrieval of board groups, addition of comments, listing of boards, and management of sub-items directly through code. This eliminates manual intervention in routine project management tasks and ensures real-time synchronization between development processes and project tracking.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build custom automation scripts, integrate Monday.com with CI/CD pipelines, create dashboards that pull live project data, or develop bots that update project status based on code changes. The integration supports complex project hierarchies and facilitates better coordination between technical and non-technical team members by keeping everyone aligned through automated updates and notifications.
