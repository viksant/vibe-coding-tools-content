# Paddle

The Paddle MCP server provides a comprehensive interface for developers to integrate Paddle's powerful monetization platform into their applications. This tool enables seamless management of your entire product catalog, including creating and updating products, plans, and pricing. It also handles complex billing operations such as subscription lifecycle management, invoicing, and payment processing, making it ideal for SaaS businesses and digital product sellers.

With this MCP, developers can automate financial reporting, track revenue metrics, and manage customer subscriptions programmatically. It supports webhook integrations for real-time notifications about subscription events, failed payments, and customer updates. This eliminates the need for manual intervention in e-commerce operations and provides a scalable solution for businesses looking to streamline their monetization infrastructure while maintaining PCI compliance and secure payment handling.
