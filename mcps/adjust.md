The Adjust MCP server allows developers to easily connect with Adjust's marketing analytics platform using natural language. This means you can ask about campaign performance, attribution metrics, and detailed reports without the hassle of switching between different tools or writing complicated API calls.

You can simply pose questions about user acquisition, ROI, retention rates, and other important marketing metrics in everyday language.

This tool is a game-changer for marketing teams, data analysts, and developers who want quick access to performance insights during planning or troubleshooting sessions. 

By cutting out the need to navigate the Adjust dashboard or create API queries manually, it makes the analytics process smoother and helps you make faster decisions based on real-time marketing data.
