# Adjust

The Adjust MCP server enables developers to interact with Adjust's marketing analytics platform through natural language queries. This integration allows you to retrieve campaign performance data, attribution metrics, and detailed reports without switching contexts or writing complex API calls. You can ask questions about user acquisition, ROI, retention rates, and other key marketing KPIs in plain English.

This tool is particularly valuable for marketing teams, data analysts, and developers who need quick access to performance insights during planning sessions or troubleshooting. By eliminating the need to navigate the Adjust dashboard or construct API queries manually, it streamlines the analytics workflow and enables faster decision-making based on real-time marketing data.
