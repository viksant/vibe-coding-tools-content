# Atlassian

The Atlassian MCP provides seamless integration between Cursor's AI-powered development environment and Jira's comprehensive project management platform. This connection allows developers to query, create, and update Jira issues directly from their code editor, streamlining workflows and reducing context switching. Developers can search for tickets, check status updates, assign tasks, and manage sprints without leaving their coding environment.

The integration enhances team productivity by bringing project management directly into the development workflow. Use cases include automatically creating Jira tickets for bugs detected during coding, fetching relevant issue details when working on specific features, and updating ticket status as code changes are committed. This MCP is particularly valuable for agile teams following Scrum or Kanban methodologies, providing real-time synchronization between code changes and project tracking.
