# Agentset

Agentset is an open-source platform specifically designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), empowering developers to create sophisticated applications that leverage external knowledge sources. It provides the essential tools to ingest, process, and retrieve information from documents, which is then used to ground the responses of large language models (LLMs), ensuring more accurate and contextually relevant outputs. This approach significantly enhances the capabilities of AI applications by reducing hallucinations and improving factuality.

By abstracting away the complexities of vector databases, embedding models, and retrieval pipelines, Agentset enables rapid prototyping and deployment of intelligent systems like AI-powered chatbots, research assistants, and enterprise knowledge bases. Developers can focus on their application logic and user experience, accelerating the journey from concept to a fully functional, document-aware AI agent. It is ideal for building applications that require deep, reliable interaction with specific corpora of text, such as technical documentation, legal contracts, or internal company knowledge.
