# Documentation from LLM txt

This MCP server allows Claude to access and utilize documentation generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) from both local files and remote sources. Developers can provide LLM-generated technical documentation, API references, or code explanations that Claude can reference during conversations, ensuring accurate and context-aware technical support. This is particularly valuable for projects where documentation is dynamically generated or frequently updated by AI systems.

The tool supports various documentation formats and sources, enabling seamless integration of AI-generated content into development workflows. Use cases include accessing automatically generated API documentation, incorporating LLM-created code explanations, or referencing dynamically updated project specifications. This enhances Claude's ability to provide precise technical guidance while maintaining consistency with your project's specific documentation ecosystem.
