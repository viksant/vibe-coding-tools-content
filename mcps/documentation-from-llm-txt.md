Claude's MCP server opens the door for accessing and using documentation created by Large Language Models (LLMs). Whether itâ€™s from local files or online sources, Claude can tap into this wealth of information.

Developers can supply LLM-generated technical documents, API references, or code explanations. Claude uses this material during conversations, which helps ensure that technical support remains accurate and relevant. This feature is especially handy for projects where documentation changes often due to AI systems.

The tool accommodates various documentation formats and sources, making it easy to bring AI-generated content into your development processes.

Imagine using it to access automatically generated API docs, adding LLM-created code explanations, or referring to project specs that update in real time. This capability boosts Claude's ability to deliver precise technical advice while aligning with your project's unique documentation setup.
