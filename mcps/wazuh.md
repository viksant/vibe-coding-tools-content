# Wazuh

The Wazuh MCP enables seamless integration with the Wazuh open-source security platform, providing developers and security teams with real-time access to security alerts, event data, and threat intelligence. This integration allows for automated retrieval of security events from Elasticsearch indices, enabling continuous monitoring and analysis of security incidents across your infrastructure.

By leveraging this MCP, security operations teams can streamline their threat detection and response workflows, automate security reporting, and enhance their overall security posture. Use cases include real-time alert monitoring, automated incident response, security dashboard creation, and compliance reporting, making it ideal for organizations needing robust security monitoring capabilities without manual data extraction processes.
