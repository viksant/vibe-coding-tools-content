# WildFly

This MCP provides comprehensive integration with WildFly application servers, enabling developers to monitor server health, configure resources, and manage performance metrics through a unified interface. It allows real-time tracking of JVM metrics, datasource usage, and application deployments, giving teams full visibility into their WildFly environments.

Developers can automate server configuration, perform administrative tasks, and troubleshoot issues efficiently. The MCP supports both standalone and domain mode operations, making it ideal for production environments where reliability and performance monitoring are critical. Use cases include automated deployment pipelines, performance optimization, and centralized management of multiple WildFly instances across development, staging, and production environments.
