# Sourcerer MCP

Sourcerer MCP provides intelligent semantic search capabilities for codebases, allowing AI agents to navigate complex code repositories with precision and efficiency. Instead of scanning entire files line by line, agents can search using natural language concepts and jump directly to relevant functions, classes, or code segments. This approach dramatically reduces token consumption while improving code comprehension and navigation accuracy.

The MCP server enables developers to build AI-powered tools that understand code context and relationships, supporting use cases like automated code review, intelligent refactoring assistance, and rapid feature implementation. By providing semantic understanding of code structure and purpose, it helps agents work more effectively across large codebases, reducing development time and improving code quality through targeted, context-aware interactions.
