# PDF Reader

The PDF Reader MCP provides robust functionality for reading and extracting content from both protected and unprotected PDF files. This tool enables developers to programmatically access text, metadata, and structural elements from PDF documents, supporting a wide range of document processing workflows. It handles various PDF security measures while maintaining content integrity.

This MCP is particularly valuable for document analysis, content indexing, and data extraction pipelines. Developers can build applications that automatically process large volumes of PDFs for knowledge management systems, legal document review, academic research, or business intelligence. The extracted content can be integrated with other systems for search, analysis, or transformation, making it ideal for automating document-heavy workflows across multiple industries.
