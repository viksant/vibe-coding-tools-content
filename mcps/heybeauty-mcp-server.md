# HeyBeauty MCP Server

HeyBeauty MCP Server provides developers with tools and APIs to implement virtual try-on capabilities for beauty and cosmetic products. This MCP enables realistic augmented reality experiences where users can visualize makeup, hairstyles, accessories, and other beauty products in real-time through camera feeds or uploaded images. The server handles complex computer vision tasks, facial feature detection, and product rendering while providing simple integration endpoints.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build immersive shopping experiences, beauty consultation apps, and social media filters. It supports various beauty categories including cosmetics, hair color, jewelry, and accessories with accurate color matching and realistic application effects. The MCP simplifies the complex computer vision and AR implementation, allowing developers to focus on creating engaging user experiences rather than building the underlying technology from scratch.
