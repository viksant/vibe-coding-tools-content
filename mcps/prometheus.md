# Prometheus

This MCP provides seamless integration with Prometheus, enabling developers to query and analyze time-series metrics data directly within their workflow. It supports real-time monitoring of system performance, application metrics, and infrastructure health through Prometheus' powerful query language (PromQL). Developers can retrieve metrics, create custom dashboards, set up alerts, and gain deep insights into their systems' behavior.

The integration empowers teams to monitor microservices, containers, and distributed systems effectively. Use cases include performance troubleshooting, capacity planning, SLA monitoring, and automated alerting for production systems. By bringing Prometheus capabilities directly into the development environment, this MCP helps maintain system reliability and optimize resource utilization across complex architectures.
