This MCP helps developers work with GEDCOM files, which are the go-to format for sharing genealogical data. With this tool, you can easily parse, query, and analyze the information in these files. It offers features to pull out individual records, family relationships, events, and source citations, making it simple to create detailed family trees and visualizations.

Developers can use this MCP to create applications that trace ancestry, calculate relationships, validate genealogical data, and generate insightful reports.

This tool also supports complex genealogical queries, like finding common ancestors, calculating degrees of separation, and spotting family patterns through generations. It proves especially useful for genealogy platforms, historical research tools, and family history applications that need to handle standardized genealogical data efficiently.

The interface takes care of the tricky parts of GEDCOM parsing, allowing developers to concentrate on developing meaningful genealogy features without getting bogged down by file format details.
