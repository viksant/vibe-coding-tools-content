# GEDCOM Ancestry Files

This MCP enables developers to parse, query, and analyze GEDCOM (Genealogical Data Communication) files, the standard format for genealogical data exchange. It provides tools to extract individual records, family relationships, events, and source citations, allowing for comprehensive family tree analysis and visualization. Developers can build applications that trace ancestry, calculate relationships, validate genealogical data, and generate reports.

The MCP supports complex genealogical queries such as finding common ancestors, calculating degrees of separation, and identifying familial patterns across generations. It's particularly valuable for genealogy platforms, historical research tools, and family history applications that need to process standardized genealogical data efficiently. The interface handles GEDCOM parsing complexities, letting developers focus on building meaningful genealogy features rather than file format intricacies.
