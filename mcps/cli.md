# CLI

The CLI MCP enables developers to interact directly with their host machine's command-line interface, allowing execution of system commands, scripts, and automation tasks. This provides seamless integration with local development environments, system utilities, and custom automation workflows that require direct shell access.

Developers can leverage this MCP for tasks like file system operations, process management, package installation, and running build scripts. It bridges the gap between AI assistants and local development workflows, enabling automated testing, deployment pipelines, and system administration tasks without leaving the chat interface. This is particularly valuable for DevOps engineers and developers working with complex local development setups.
