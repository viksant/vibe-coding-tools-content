# Singapore LTA

This MCP provides seamless integration with Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) DataMall API, enabling developers to build sophisticated urban mobility solutions with access to comprehensive, real-time transportation data. The server handles authentication, rate limiting, and data normalization, allowing you to focus on building applications that leverage live bus arrival times, train service status, taxi availability, traffic conditions, and other critical transport information.

Developers can create applications ranging from real-time transit tracking systems and multimodal journey planners to urban analytics dashboards and smart city solutions. The MCP simplifies working with LTA's complex API structure, providing clean, structured data outputs that support everything from consumer-facing mobile apps to enterprise-level transportation management systems and urban planning tools.
