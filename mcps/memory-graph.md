# Memory Graph

The Memory Graph MCP provides long-term memory capabilities for LLM applications by leveraging Redis Graph's graph database functionality. This enables developers to build conversational AI systems that maintain context across multiple interactions, creating persistent knowledge graphs that evolve with each conversation. The graph-based storage allows for complex relationship mapping between concepts, users, and conversation history.

Developers can use this MCP to create sophisticated AI assistants that remember user preferences, conversation context, and domain-specific knowledge over time. It supports building applications like personalized chatbots, knowledge management systems, and context-aware AI agents that learn from previous interactions. The Redis Graph backend ensures efficient querying of complex relationships while providing reliable persistence for long-running conversational workflows.
