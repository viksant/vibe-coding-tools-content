The Digma MCP Server connects runtime observability with AI-assisted development. It works hand-in-hand with popular application performance management tools like Datadog, Grafana, and NewRelic.

Here's how it works: the server analyzes live application performance data and delivers contextual insights right in the development workflow. This setup empowers AI agents to make informed decisions during code reviews, generate tests, and suggest fixes.

By tapping into actual production metrics, Digma helps developers spot performance bottlenecks, manage resource usage better, and lower cloud costs before issues arise.

Whatâ€™s more, the MCP server turns observability data into actionable intelligence. This means AI agents can recommend improvements based on real-world usage patterns, moving beyond just static code analysis. The outcome? More reliable, effective, and budget-friendly software development cycles.
