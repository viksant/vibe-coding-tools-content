The Digma MCP Server bridges the gap between runtime observability and AI-assisted development by integrating with popular APM tools like Datadog, Grafana, and NewRelic. 

It analyzes live application performance data to provide contextual insights directly within the development workflow. This enables AI agents to make data-driven decisions during code reviews, test generation, and fix suggestions.

By leveraging actual production metrics, Digma helps developers identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and reduce cloud costs proactively. 

The MCP server transforms observability data into actionable intelligence, allowing AI agents to suggest improvements based on real-world usage patterns rather than static code analysis alone. This results in more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective software development cycles.
