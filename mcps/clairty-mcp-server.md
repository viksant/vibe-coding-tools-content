# Clairty-mcp-server

Clairty-mcp-server offers a collection of synthetic prompt templates designed to augment reasoning capabilities in AI systems. These templates provide structured frameworks for different types of logical thinking, including causal reasoning, comparative analysis, and step-by-step problem decomposition. Developers can integrate these templates to improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated responses across various applications.

The server enables more sophisticated AI interactions by providing pre-built reasoning patterns that help models approach complex problems systematically. Use cases include enhancing chatbot reasoning, improving decision support systems, and building more reliable AI assistants that can break down multi-step problems and provide transparent reasoning chains. This is particularly valuable for applications requiring logical consistency and explainable AI outputs.
