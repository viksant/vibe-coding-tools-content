# Fetch (Mozilla Readability)

This MCP integrates Mozilla's Readability algorithm to intelligently extract and transform webpage content into clean, structured Markdown optimized for LLM consumption. It automatically removes clutter like ads, navigation bars, and other non-essential elements while preserving the core article content, headings, and formatting. This enables developers to work with clean, focused text from any webpage without manual cleaning or preprocessing.

The tool is particularly valuable for building applications that require reliable content extraction for analysis, summarization, or processing by language models. Use cases include building web scrapers, content aggregation tools, research assistants, or any system that needs to process web content efficiently. By providing consistently formatted Markdown output, it ensures better results when feeding content to LLMs and reduces the complexity of handling raw HTML parsing.
