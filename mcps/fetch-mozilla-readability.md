This MCP brings in Mozilla's Readability algorithm to help you easily extract and transform webpage content into neat, structured Markdown that's perfect for LLM use.

It smartly clears away distractions like ads and navigation bars, focusing only on the main article content, headings, and essential formatting. This means developers can grab clean, relevant text from any webpage without having to do any tedious manual cleanup.

This tool shines when you're building applications that need reliable content extraction for tasks like analysis, summarization, or working with language models.

Think about use cases such as creating web scrapers, developing content aggregation tools, or building research assistants. If your system needs to process web content smoothly, this MCP provides consistently formatted Markdown output. This leads to better results when you feed it to LLMs and makes handling raw HTML much simpler.
