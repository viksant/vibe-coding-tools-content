# mcp-odbc

This MCP provides a standardized Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface that enables developers to connect to any Database Management System (DBMS) that supports ODBC drivers. It abstracts away the complexities of different database protocols and provides a unified API for executing SQL queries, managing transactions, and handling result sets across diverse database platforms.

Developers can use this MCP to build applications that require database-agnostic connectivity, supporting use cases like multi-database reporting tools, data migration utilities, and cross-platform database management systems. The ODBC standard ensures compatibility with enterprise databases, cloud data warehouses, and legacy systems alike, making it ideal for organizations with heterogeneous database environments or those needing flexible database connectivity without vendor lock-in.
