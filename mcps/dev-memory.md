# Dev Memory

Dev Memory MCP provides persistent cross-project memory storage and retrieval capabilities, enabling developers to maintain crucial development context and knowledge across different projects and work sessions. This eliminates the need to constantly re-establish context when switching between tasks or returning to projects after breaks, significantly improving development efficiency and reducing cognitive load.

The system allows for storing project-specific information, code patterns, API documentation, debugging insights, and other valuable knowledge that can be retrieved on-demand. This is particularly beneficial for teams working on multiple codebases, developers maintaining legacy systems, or anyone needing to preserve institutional knowledge. By providing a centralized memory layer, it ensures continuity and accelerates onboarding while reducing context-switching overhead.
