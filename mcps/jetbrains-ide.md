This MCP server connects large language models with JetBrains IDEs, allowing developers to access AI assistance right in their development environment. 

You'll find intelligent code completion that understands the context of your project. It also offers automated refactoring tools that help keep your code quality high, along with documentation generation that tailors itself to your specific codebase.

What's the benefit? This integration boosts developer productivity by cutting down on manual coding tasks and enhancing code consistency.

Developers gain from AI-assisted debugging and smarter code suggestions that align with project patterns. Plus, the automated documentation updates automatically with code changes. This feature is especially helpful for large codebases, where keeping everything consistent and of high quality across multiple files can be tough.
