# GitHub Projects

This MCP provides seamless integration with GitHub Projects, enabling developers to manage their entire Agile development lifecycle within the familiar GitHub ecosystem. It allows for automated project creation, task assignment, and sprint planning directly through the MCP interface, eliminating context switching between different tools. Developers can create and manage issues, track progress across multiple sprints, and maintain visibility into team workflows without leaving their development environment.

The integration supports comprehensive project management capabilities including backlog grooming, sprint planning, and progress tracking. Teams can leverage GitHub's native project boards, automate task assignments based on predefined workflows, and maintain synchronized project status across their development pipeline. This is particularly valuable for teams practicing Scrum or Kanban methodologies who want to keep their project management tightly coupled with their codebase and development activities.
