The Unified Diff Generator MCP provides a specialized tool for creating unified diff outputs between text strings, automatically including 3 lines of context around each change. This enables developers to perform precise text comparisons for version control systems, code review processes, and content tracking applications.

The unified diff format is the standard used by Git and other version control systems, making this MCP essential for understanding code changes and modifications.

By generating diffs with proper context lines, this tool helps developers quickly identify what has been added, removed, or modified between different versions of text. 

It supports various use cases including code review automation, document version comparison, configuration file tracking, and educational purposes where understanding incremental changes is crucial. 

The MCP's output follows the standard unified diff format, ensuring compatibility with existing development tools and workflows.
