The Unified Diff Generator MCP is a handy tool that helps you create unified diff outputs between text strings. It automatically adds three lines of context around each change, making it easier for developers to compare text accurately. This feature is particularly useful for version control systems, code reviews, and tracking changes in content.

Why is the unified diff format important? It’s the standard for Git and other version control systems. This makes the MCP crucial for anyone looking to understand code changes and modifications clearly.

With this tool, you can quickly spot what has been added, removed, or modified between different text versions. It's versatile too! Whether you’re automating code reviews, comparing document versions, tracking configuration files, or learning about incremental changes, this tool has you covered.

Plus, the output aligns with the standard unified diff format, ensuring it works smoothly with your existing development tools and processes.
