The Bazi MCP provides accurate and structured Bazi (Four Pillars of Destiny) data for personality analysis and destiny forecasting applications. Unlike generic AI tools that often produce inconsistent or inaccurate results for metaphysical calculations, this MCP delivers reliable Bazi information based on traditional Chinese astrological principles. 

It handles complex calculations involving heavenly stems, earthly branches, and their interactions with precision.

Developers can integrate this MCP to build applications for personal development, relationship compatibility analysis, career guidance, and life path forecasting. The API ensures consistent results for birth chart calculations, element analysis, and fortune cycles, making it suitable for wellness apps, cultural preservation tools, and metaphysical research platforms. 

By providing standardized Bazi data, it enables developers to focus on building user experiences rather than implementing complex astrological algorithms.
