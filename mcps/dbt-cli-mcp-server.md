This MCP server provides a standardized interface for AI coding agents to interact with dbt (data build tool) projects through the dbt CLI. 

It enables automated management of data transformation workflows, including model compilation, testing, documentation generation, and deployment operations. Developers can build intelligent data engineering assistants that understand dbt project structures and execute complex data transformation tasks programmatically.

The server supports full dbt CLI functionality, allowing AI agents to run models, validate data quality, generate documentation, and manage dependencies. 

This facilitates the creation of automated data pipeline monitoring, intelligent schema evolution, and collaborative data development workflows where AI agents can assist with data transformation logic and optimization.
