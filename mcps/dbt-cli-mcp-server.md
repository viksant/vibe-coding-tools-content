This MCP server acts as a bridge for AI coding agents to connect with dbt (data build tool) projects via the dbt CLI. 

It streamlines the management of data transformation tasks such as model compilation, testing, documentation generation, and deployment. With this setup, developers can create smart data engineering assistants that recognize dbt project structures and handle complex data transformation tasks automatically.

The server fully supports all dbt CLI features. This means AI agents can run models, check data quality, create documentation, and handle dependencies with ease.

As a result, you can set up automated monitoring for data pipelines, intelligent schema evolution, and collaborative workflows where AI agents support data transformation logic and enhancements.
