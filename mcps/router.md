# Router

The Router MCP serves as a centralized gateway that aggregates multiple MCP resource servers into a single unified proxy. This enables developers to access diverse MCP services through a single endpoint while maintaining organized request routing and response aggregation capabilities. The router intelligently directs requests to appropriate backend servers based on configured routing rules, simplifying complex multi-server architectures.

By providing a unified interface, the Router MCP reduces integration complexity and improves system reliability through centralized error handling and monitoring. Developers benefit from streamlined access to multiple MCP services without managing individual connections, making it ideal for building sophisticated applications that leverage multiple specialized MCP servers. This approach enhances scalability and maintainability while ensuring consistent performance across distributed MCP resources.
