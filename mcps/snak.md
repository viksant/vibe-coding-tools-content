# Snak

Snak MCP empowers developers to build and deploy AI agents directly on the Starknet blockchain network. This MCP provides the necessary infrastructure for creating intelligent agents that can interact with smart contracts, process on-chain data, and execute blockchain transactions securely. It combines AI capabilities with Starknet's scalability and security features, enabling the development of decentralized AI applications that operate transparently on-chain.

The framework includes tools for agent orchestration, secure key management, and gas optimization, making it easier to deploy production-ready AI systems on Starknet. Developers can create agents that perform automated trading, decentralized governance, or complex computational tasks while leveraging Starknet's zero-knowledge proof technology for enhanced privacy and scalability. This opens up new possibilities for AI-driven decentralized applications that require both intelligence and blockchain security.
