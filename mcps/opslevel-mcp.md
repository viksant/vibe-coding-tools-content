The OpsLevel MCP server connects smoothly with the OpsLevel platform, which serves as a complete service catalog and developer portal.

With this MCP, AI assistants and development tools can easily tap into OpsLevel's capabilities for service ownership, documentation, and maturity tracking. Developers can look up service information, update documentation, check on service health, and manage ownership details right from their favorite development environment.

This connection makes finding services easier, boosts documentation habits, and fosters better teamwork by keeping service information accessible within development workflows. 

This is especially helpful for organizations that use microservices architecture or platform engineering, where having an accurate service catalog and defined ownership is essential for keeping operations running smoothly and enhancing developer productivity.
