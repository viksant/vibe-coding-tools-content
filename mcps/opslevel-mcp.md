# OpsLevel MCP

The OpsLevel MCP server provides seamless integration with the OpsLevel platform, a comprehensive service catalog and developer portal solution. This MCP enables AI assistants and development tools to interact with OpsLevel's service ownership, documentation, and maturity tracking capabilities. Developers can query service information, update documentation, check service health, and manage ownership details directly through their preferred development environment.

This integration streamlines service discovery, improves documentation practices, and enhances team collaboration by making service information readily available within development workflows. It's particularly valuable for organizations practicing microservices architecture or platform engineering, where maintaining accurate service catalogs and clear ownership is crucial for operational efficiency and developer productivity.
