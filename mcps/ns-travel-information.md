# NS Travel Information

This MCP server provides developers with programmatic access to real-time Dutch Railways (NS) travel data, enabling the creation of intelligent trip planning applications and travel information services. Developers can query live train schedules, departure/arrival times, platform information, and service disruptions, allowing for dynamic route optimization and real-time travel updates.

The integration supports building applications that help users plan journeys, receive alerts for delays or cancellations, and access comprehensive travel information across the Dutch rail network. This is particularly valuable for transportation apps, travel planners, and logistics systems that require accurate, up-to-date railway data to provide reliable service to end users.
