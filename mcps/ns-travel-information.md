This MCP server gives developers easy access to real-time travel data from Dutch Railways (NS). With this information, they can build smart trip planning apps and travel services.

Developers can check live train schedules, find out departure and arrival times, see platform details, and stay informed about service disruptions. This means they can offer users optimized routes and real-time updates on their travels.

This integration is a game changer for apps focused on transportation, travel planning, and logistics. It provides accurate, up-to-date railway data, ensuring that users receive reliable information for their journeys across the Dutch rail network.
