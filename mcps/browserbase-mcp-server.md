# Browserbase MCP Server

The Browserbase MCP Server provides a powerful interface for large language models to programmatically control web browsers through Browserbase's cloud infrastructure and Stagehand's automation framework. This enables developers to automate complex web interactions, perform end-to-end testing, scrape dynamic content, and simulate user behavior at scale without managing local browser instances.

Key benefits include reliable browser automation with built-in session management, headless operation for efficiency, and seamless integration with existing development workflows. Use cases range from automated testing of web applications, data extraction from JavaScript-heavy sites, to performance monitoring and compliance checking across different browser environments.
