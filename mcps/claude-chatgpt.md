This MCP enables seamless integration between Claude and the ChatGPT desktop application on macOS systems. 

Using AppleScript automation, it allows developers to send prompts from Claude to ChatGPT, retrieve responses, and manage conversations across both AI assistants. This creates powerful workflows where developers can leverage the unique strengths of each assistant—combining Claude's reasoning capabilities with ChatGPT's conversational style for enhanced problem-solving.

The integration supports automated prompt routing, response synchronization, and conversation history management. 

Developers can build applications that orchestrate interactions between multiple AI systems, create comparative analysis tools, or develop sophisticated chat interfaces that intelligently route queries to the most appropriate assistant based on context, complexity, or specialized capabilities.
