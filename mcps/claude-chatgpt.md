This MCP makes it easy to connect Claude with the ChatGPT desktop application on macOS. 

Using AppleScript automation, developers can send prompts from Claude to ChatGPT and get responses back. This setup allows for smooth conversations between both AI assistants. As a result, developers can harness the best features of eachâ€”merging Claude's reasoning skills with ChatGPT's engaging conversational style to tackle problems more effectively.

The integration also helps with automated prompt routing, keeping responses in sync, and managing conversation history. 

With this tool, developers can create applications that coordinate interactions among various AI systems, build comparative analysis tools, or design advanced chat interfaces. These interfaces can smartly direct questions to the right assistant based on the context, the complexity of the inquiry, or specific expertise.
