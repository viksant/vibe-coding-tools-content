The Rootly MCP server brings incident management right into your development workspace. By connecting to the Rootly API, it lets developers tackle incidents without having to switch contexts.

This means you can create, update, and resolve incidents without losing your focus on the code you're working on.

With real-time incident context, status updates, and collaboration features, the server suits DevOps teams looking for quick incident response and resolution right within their usual coding environment.
