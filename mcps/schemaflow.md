SchemaFlow makes it easy to keep your AI development environments up to speed with live database schema information. It does this through secure Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections, which means your AI assistants always have the latest database context at their fingertips.

The MCP server comes with three key tools to boost your development process:

- **get_schema** helps you retrieve schema information instantly.
- **analyze_database** offers a thorough analysis of your database.
- **check_schema_alignment** checks your code against the current database structures to ensure everything matches up.

With these tools, developers can generate smarter code, cut down on schema-related errors, and create more effective workflows that consider the database. This is especially important for teams managing rapidly changing database schemas in production.
