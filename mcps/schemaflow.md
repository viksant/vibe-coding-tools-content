SchemaFlow delivers live database schema information to AI development environments through secure Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections, ensuring AI assistants always work with up-to-date database context. 

This MCP server provides three core tools: 

- **get_schema** for instant schema retrieval, 
- **analyze_database** for comprehensive database analysis, 
- **check_schema_alignment** for validating code against current database structures. 

Developers gain smarter code generation, reduced schema-related errors, and improved database-aware development workflows. This makes it essential for teams working with rapidly evolving database schemas in production environments.
