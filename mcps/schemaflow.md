# SchemaFlow

SchemaFlow delivers live database schema information to AI development environments through secure Server-Sent Events (SSE) connections, ensuring AI assistants always work with up-to-date database context. This MCP server provides three core tools: get_schema for instant schema retrieval, analyze_database for comprehensive database analysis, and check_schema_alignment for validating code against current database structures. Developers gain smarter code generation, reduced schema-related errors, and improved database-aware development workflows, making it essential for teams working with rapidly evolving database schemas in production environments.
