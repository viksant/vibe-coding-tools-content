# Mobile MCP - iOS/Android automation and development

The Mobile MCP server provides a unified interface for automating iOS and Android applications without requiring platform-specific expertise. It enables AI agents to interact with native mobile apps through two primary methods: structured accessibility snapshots that expose UI elements and their properties, or coordinate-based interactions using screenshot analysis for visual automation. This approach abstracts away the complexities of mobile platform differences, allowing developers to write automation scripts that work across both major mobile ecosystems.

The server supports real devices including iPhone, Samsung, and Google Pixel, making it ideal for cross-platform testing, mobile app quality assurance, and automated workflow execution. Developers can build scalable automation pipelines for regression testing, user journey validation, and continuous integration workflows. By providing a standardized interface for mobile interaction, this MCP eliminates the need for maintaining separate automation codebases for iOS and Android, significantly reducing development overhead and enabling true cross-platform mobile automation at scale.
