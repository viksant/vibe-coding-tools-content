# Mailtrap Email Sending MCP

This MCP server enables developers to integrate Mailtrap's email sending capabilities directly into their development workflows. It provides programmatic access to Mailtrap's transactional email API, allowing for automated email testing, template management, and production email delivery from within development environments. Developers can use this MCP to test email functionality during development, validate email templates, monitor delivery status, and ensure reliable email communication in their applications without manual intervention.

The MCP supports various email operations including sending individual emails, batch processing, template rendering, and delivery tracking. It's particularly valuable for testing email workflows during development, ensuring email deliverability before production deployment, and automating email-related tasks in CI/CD pipelines. This eliminates the need for manual email testing and provides confidence that email functionality will work correctly in production environments.
