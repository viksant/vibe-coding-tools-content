This MCP server connects AI agents directly to Hasura GraphQL APIs, allowing them to interact seamlessly with your data. 

With this setup, agents can easily discover GraphQL schemas, run complex queries and mutations, gather data from various sources, and keep an eye on API health. 

This capability turns AI assistants into robust tools for exploring data. They can pull accurate information, carry out data transformations, and deliver real-time insightsâ€”all without needing manual API setup. 

For developers, this means they can create smart applications that use natural language interfaces to access structured data effectively.
