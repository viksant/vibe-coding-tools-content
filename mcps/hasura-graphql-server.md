# Hasura GraphQL Server

This MCP server provides AI agents with direct access to Hasura GraphQL APIs, enabling comprehensive interaction with your data layer. Agents can automatically discover GraphQL schemas, execute complex queries and mutations, aggregate data from multiple sources, and monitor API health status. This transforms AI assistants into powerful data exploration tools that can retrieve precise information, perform data transformations, and provide real-time insights without manual API configuration. Developers can build intelligent applications that leverage structured data access through natural language interfaces.
