# Git

The Git MCP provides comprehensive version control capabilities by integrating directly with Git repositories. It supports both shell-based Git commands and the go-git library, offering developers flexible implementation options for various use cases. This enables automated Git workflows, repository management, and version control operations directly within MCP-powered applications.

Developers can leverage this MCP to automate common Git tasks like committing changes, branching, merging, and repository synchronization. It's particularly valuable for CI/CD pipelines, automated deployment scripts, and collaborative development workflows where programmatic Git operations are essential. The dual implementation approach ensures compatibility across different environments while maintaining robust version control functionality.
