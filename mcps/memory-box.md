# Memory Box

The Memory Box MCP provides developers with semantic memory capabilities that enable AI applications to maintain persistent context across interactions. By leveraging vector embeddings and similarity search, it allows systems to store, retrieve, and reason with contextual information in a way that understands semantic relationships rather than just keyword matching. This enables more natural, continuous conversations and intelligent applications that remember past interactions and build upon them.

Developers can use this MCP to create AI agents with long-term memory, build context-aware chatbots that remember user preferences, or develop applications that need to maintain state across sessions. The semantic search capabilities allow for intelligent retrieval of relevant information based on meaning rather than exact matches, making it ideal for knowledge management systems, personalized assistants, and any application requiring persistent, intelligent memory.
