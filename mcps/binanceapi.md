With this setup, you can monitor prices in real time, analyze charts, inspect order books, and retrieve trading history, all using natural language queries.

AI agents offer immediate market insights, keep track of your portfolio's performance, analyze trading patterns, and help make smart investment decisions based on data.

This integration caters to everyone, from casual investors looking for market information to professional traders needing advanced analytics. You can access all these features through conversational interfaces with Claude, Cursor, and other AI platforms.
