This MCP tool offers a simple API endpoint for creating Google Calendar events. With it, AI voice agents and other applications can easily schedule meetings and appointments directly.

Developers can add calendar features to their applications without dealing with complicated OAuth flows or Google API integrations. 

The tool takes care of authentication and communication with Google Calendar, making event creation straightforward. You can use standard parameters like title, description, start and end times, and attendees.

This opens up possibilities for AI scheduling assistants, automated meeting coordination, and calendar management systems that respond to natural language requests and create events in users' Google Calendars.
