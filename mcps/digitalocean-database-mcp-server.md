This MCP server connects AI-driven development environments with DigitalOcean's managed database services. It takes away the hassle of handling credentials manually.

Now, developers can use their DigitalOcean API token to easily find and connect to any database cluster. This streamlines database tasks right from their favorite IDE.

With this integration, developers can run queries in real time, explore schemas, and manage data using simple natural language commands. This approach makes working with databases smoother and more secure throughout the development process.
