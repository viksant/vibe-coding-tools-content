# Redshift

This MCP server provides secure, read-only access to Amazon Redshift data warehouses, allowing large language models to inspect database schemas and execute SQL queries without modification capabilities. Developers can leverage this integration to enable AI assistants to analyze data patterns, generate reports, and answer complex business intelligence questions directly from their Redshift clusters.

The server supports schema exploration, table metadata inspection, and complex query execution while maintaining data security through read-only permissions. This enables use cases such as automated data analysis, business intelligence reporting, and AI-powered data exploration without risking data modification. Teams can build intelligent applications that combine LLM reasoning with large-scale data warehouse insights for enhanced decision-making and analytics workflows.
