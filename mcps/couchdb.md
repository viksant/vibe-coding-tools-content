# CouchDB

The CouchDB MCP provides a comprehensive interface for managing CouchDB databases, allowing developers to perform document operations, run Mango queries, and handle database administration tasks programmatically. This integration enables seamless interaction with CouchDB's document-oriented storage system, supporting create, read, update, and delete operations while leveraging CouchDB's built-in versioning and conflict resolution capabilities.

Developers can build applications that require flexible schema design, real-time data synchronization, and distributed database architectures. The MCP supports complex querying through Mango Query syntax, replication management, and document validation, making it ideal for content management systems, mobile applications, and IoT platforms that benefit from CouchDB's master-master replication and offline-first capabilities.
