Cursor10x MCP is a memory system built for Cursor development environments. It operates across multiple dimensions, making it quite unique.

So, what does it do? It boosts AI assistants by keeping track of conversation context, project history, and code relationships over various sessions. This means developers can work more smoothly with AI assistants that remember past interactions, code patterns, and the overall project context.

With this system, you gain ongoing context awareness. This leads to smarter code suggestions, enhanced problem-solving help, and a smoother development experience overall.
