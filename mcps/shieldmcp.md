ShieldMCP is a handy abstraction library that helps developers debug and sanitize their code effectively. It provides a straightforward API that allows you to instrument your code, capture runtime errors, and validate inputs. This means you can spot and fix issues early in the development process.

By simplifying common debugging practices and security checks, ShieldMCP cuts down on repetitive code and ensures consistency across different projects.

The library focuses on solid practices, making sure that the tools you create with ShieldMCP are both fast and secure. It’s perfect for a variety of tasks, like automated input validation, error tracking, and runtime monitoring. Whether you’re developing APIs, command-line interfaces, or backend services, it fits right in.

With ShieldMCP, your team can keep code quality high, make debugging smoother, and protect against common security vulnerabilities through organized sanitization.
