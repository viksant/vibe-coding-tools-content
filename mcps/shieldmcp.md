# ShieldMCP

ShieldMCP is a specialized abstraction library that provides robust debugging and sanitization capabilities for developers building secure and reliable tools. It offers a clean API for instrumenting code, capturing runtime errors, and validating inputs, helping developers catch issues early in the development cycle. By abstracting common debugging patterns and security checks, ShieldMCP reduces boilerplate and enforces consistency across projects.

The library is designed with best practices in mind, ensuring that tools built with ShieldMCP are both performant and secure. It supports use cases such as automated input validation, error tracking, and runtime monitoring, making it ideal for developing APIs, CLIs, and backend services. ShieldMCP helps teams maintain high code quality, streamline debugging workflows, and prevent common security vulnerabilities through systematic sanitization.
