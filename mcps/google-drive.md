# Google Drive

This MCP server provides seamless integration with Google Drive, enabling developers to programmatically interact with files and documents stored in users' Google Drive accounts. It supports essential operations like listing files and folders, reading document content, and performing full-text searches across various formats including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and standard file types. The integration uses OAuth 2.0 authentication to ensure secure access to user content while maintaining proper authorization boundaries.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build applications that automate document processing, create content management systems, or implement intelligent search capabilities across organizational knowledge bases. The server handles the complexity of Google Drive's API, providing a clean interface for common file operations while supporting real-time collaboration features and version history access. This makes it ideal for building productivity tools, content aggregation platforms, and automated workflow systems that require reliable access to cloud-stored documents.
