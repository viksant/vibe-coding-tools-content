# Puppeteer

Puppeteer MCP enables developers to programmatically control headless Chrome or Chromium browsers to automate web interactions, test user interfaces, and generate screenshots or PDFs. This tool provides a high-level API to perform common tasks like navigating to URLs, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and extracting content from web pages, making it ideal for end-to-end testing, web scraping, and performance monitoring.

By leveraging Puppeteer through this MCP, developers can automate complex workflows, simulate user behavior for testing scenarios, and capture visual regressions. It's particularly valuable for continuous integration pipelines, generating reports from web applications, and automating repetitive web-based tasks without manual intervention.
