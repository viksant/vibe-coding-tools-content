# Fillout

The Fillout MCP enables developers to programmatically interact with the Fillout platform to build, manage, and analyze forms and surveys. It provides a comprehensive API interface for creating dynamic forms, embedding them into applications, and automating the collection of responses. This allows for seamless integration of user feedback, lead generation, and data gathering workflows directly into your development projects.

With this MCP, you can efficiently manage form submissions, set up webhooks for real-time notifications, and analyze response data to gain insights. It's ideal for building customer feedback systems, registration forms, quizzes, and any application requiring structured data input from users. The tool streamlines the entire form lifecycle from creation to analysis, making it easier to collect and utilize valuable user data.
