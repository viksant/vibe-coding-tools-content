The F2C MCP Server takes Figma design elements and turns them into polished HTML and CSS code. This tool shines when it comes to converting designs into code, offering top-notch capabilities.

What sets it apart? It gives AI coding assistants like Cursor a full understanding of the Figma design context. This means developers can work with the exact design specifications instead of having to guess.

It supports Figma file URLs along with fileKey and nodeId parameters. This feature makes the frontend development process smoother, cutting down on the need for manual translation and helping maintain design consistency throughout development.
