The F2C MCP Server transforms Figma design elements into high-fidelity HTML and CSS code, providing industry-leading design-to-code conversion capabilities. 

This tool delivers comprehensive Figma design context to AI coding assistants like Cursor, enabling developers to work with actual design specifications rather than approximations. 

By supporting Figma file URLs with fileKey and nodeId parameters, it streamlines the frontend development workflow, reducing manual translation efforts and ensuring design consistency throughout the development process.
