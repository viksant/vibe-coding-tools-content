# OSP Marketing Tools

The OSP Marketing Tools MCP provides a comprehensive suite for content and product marketing operations. It includes a standardized editing code system that ensures consistent terminology and style across all marketing materials, along with detailed writing guidelines that maintain brand voice and quality standards. The web metadata generator helps optimize content for search engines and social media platforms, improving discoverability and engagement.

This MCP also features a product communication framework that streamlines how product updates, features, and announcements are communicated to both internal teams and external audiences. Developers can integrate these tools into their marketing workflows to automate content creation, ensure compliance with brand guidelines, and maintain consistent messaging across all channels. The framework supports collaborative content development and helps marketing teams work more efficiently with technical product teams.
