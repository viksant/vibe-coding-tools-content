# Rowik (Personal MediaWiki)

The Rowik MCP provides a seamless bridge between your development environment and a personal MediaWiki instance, enabling direct interaction with your wiki's content through a structured API. This integration allows developers to programmatically search for articles, retrieve specific page content, and manipulate wiki entries, transforming static documentation into dynamic, accessible knowledge assets. By automating content lookup and updates, it eliminates context switching and manual browsing, making technical documentation, research notes, and project wikis instantly available within your workflow.

This capability is particularly valuable for managing technical specifications, API documentation, and research findings, ensuring that critical information is always at your fingertips. It supports enhanced research workflows by allowing you to query your knowledge base directly from your code editor or terminal, facilitating faster decision-making and more efficient information retrieval. The MCP effectively turns your personal wiki into an interactive knowledge engine that integrates deeply with your development tools.
