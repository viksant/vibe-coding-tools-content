# Kokoro TTS

This MCP provides seamless integration with the Kokoro TTS engine, enabling developers to incorporate high-quality text-to-speech functionality into their applications. It offers extensive customization options including voice selection, speech rate control, and audio quality settings, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases from accessibility features to interactive voice applications.

The toolkit supports cross-platform audio playback and file output, allowing developers to generate speech audio in real-time or save it as audio files for later use. This flexibility makes it ideal for building applications that require speech synthesis for accessibility tools, voice assistants, educational software, or any scenario where converting text to natural-sounding speech is needed.
