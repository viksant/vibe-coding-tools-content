The 302 Sandbox MCP offers a secure space for developers to run their code, execute commands, and manage files—all within an isolated container. This setup allows for safe testing of scripts, automation workflows, and various development tasks without putting local systems at risk.

What’s great about the sandbox is its support for multiple programming languages and shell environments. This versatility makes it perfect for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and remote development scenarios.

Getting files in and out of the sandbox is a breeze thanks to its built-in upload and download features. Developers can easily transfer code, configurations, and data between their local setup and the remote sandbox. This smooth integration with existing workflows keeps everything secure while benefiting from container isolation.

The MCP shines when it comes to testing untrusted code, handling resource-intensive tasks, or ensuring consistent execution environments throughout different development stages.
