# 302_sandbox_mcp

The 302 Sandbox MCP provides a secure remote execution environment that enables developers to run code, execute commands, and manage files in an isolated container. This allows for safe testing of scripts, automation workflows, and development tasks without compromising local systems. The sandbox supports multiple programming languages and shell environments, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and remote development scenarios.

With built-in file upload/download capabilities, developers can easily transfer code, configurations, and data between their local environment and the remote sandbox. This enables seamless integration with existing development workflows while maintaining security through container isolation. The MCP is particularly valuable for testing untrusted code, running resource-intensive tasks, or maintaining consistent execution environments across different development stages.
