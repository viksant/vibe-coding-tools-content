# Campertunity MCP Server

The Campertunity MCP Server integrates campground discovery and booking capabilities directly into Cursor, allowing developers to search for campgrounds worldwide using natural language queries. This tool enables you to check real-time availability, compare campground options, and generate direct booking links without switching contexts. It's particularly useful for developers working on travel applications, outdoor recreation platforms, or anyone needing to integrate campground data into their projects while maintaining focus on their development workflow.
