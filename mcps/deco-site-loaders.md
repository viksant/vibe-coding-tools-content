This MCP takes Deco site loaders and turns them into smart tools that understand and use metadata schemas from websites. By analyzing structured metadata, it helps users discover what a website can do and makes it easy to access this functionality through Server-Sent Events (SSE).

With this setup, developers can interact with websites in a programmatic way, tapping into their full range of features without needing to configure everything manually.

Think of it as a bridge between static website interfaces and the dynamic needs of applications. This approach works wonders for tasks like web scraping, automation, and integration workflows.

Developers can create advanced tools that automatically adjust to changes on websites, set up custom data extraction pipelines, and build real-time monitoring solutions.

The SSE-based architecture guarantees smooth and efficient communication between applications and website features. This setup supports a variety of tasks, from content aggregation to automated testing scenarios.
