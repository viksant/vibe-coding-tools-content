# Deco Site Loaders

This MCP transforms Deco site loaders into dynamic, schema-aware tools that automatically extract and leverage metadata schemas from websites. By parsing structured metadata, it enables intelligent discovery of available website capabilities and provides seamless invocation through Server-Sent Events (SSE). This allows developers to interact with websites programmatically, accessing their full functionality without manual configuration.

The system bridges the gap between static website interfaces and dynamic application needs, making it ideal for web scraping, automation, and integration workflows. Developers can build sophisticated tools that adapt to website changes automatically, create custom data extraction pipelines, and develop real-time monitoring solutions. The SSE-based architecture ensures efficient, real-time communication between applications and website capabilities, supporting everything from content aggregation to automated testing scenarios.
