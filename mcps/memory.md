This MCP provides structured memory management for project-based work by storing memories as markdown files, enabling persistent context that survives across chat sessions. 

It uses efficient Lunr.js indexing to enable fast retrieval, updating, and relationship mapping between different memories, ensuring that project context and historical information remain accessible and organized.

The system is particularly valuable for long-running projects where maintaining continuity is essential. Developers can efficiently search and relate different pieces of project knowledge, track decisions and changes over time, and build upon previous work without losing context. 

This eliminates the need to re-explain project details in each new session and supports complex workflows that require historical reference and contextual awareness.
