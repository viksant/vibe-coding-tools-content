This MCP helps you manage memories in a structured way for your project work. It saves memories as markdown files, so you can keep context alive across different chat sessions.

With Lunr.js indexing, it retrieves information quickly and allows you to update and map relationships between different memories. This means you can easily access and organize project context and historical data.

This system shines in long-running projects where you need to maintain continuity. Developers can search for and connect various pieces of project knowledge, track decisions and changes, and build on past work without losing sight of the context.

You wonâ€™t have to repeat project details in every new session, making it easier to handle complex workflows that rely on historical information and contextual understanding.
