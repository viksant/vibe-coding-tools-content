The a11y-mcp server uses axe-core to conduct thorough accessibility checks on webpages. It spots any issues related to WCAG compliance and generates in-depth reports.

This integration allows AI assistants such as Cline, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot to identify accessibility gaps and automatically suggest fixes in a smooth workflow. 

As a result, developers can simplify their accessibility testing, meet web standards, and create more inclusive user experiences by automating the resolution of accessibility issues.
