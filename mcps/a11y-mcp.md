The a11y-mcp server integrates axe-core to perform comprehensive accessibility audits on webpages, identifying WCAG compliance issues and providing detailed reports. 

This enables AI assistants like Cline, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot to analyze accessibility gaps and automatically generate fixes within an agentic workflow loop. 

Developers can streamline their accessibility testing process, ensure compliance with web standards, and deliver more inclusive user experiences through automated remediation of a11y issues.
