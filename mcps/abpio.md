The ABP.IO MCP server works hand-in-hand with the ABP Framework, making it easier to develop high-quality applications for enterprises. It comes with built-in features like multi-tenancy, permissions, audit logging, and background jobs, all set up for you.

Whatâ€™s really cool is that this server lets large language models (LLMs) create CRUD operations, user interface components, pages, and themes, all while sticking to the framework's conventions and guidelines.

Plus, it supports various UI frameworks such as MVC, Angular, and Blazor. This flexibility makes it a great choice for developers who want to build complex business applications with a consistent architecture and a range of enterprise-ready features right from the start.
