# Systemd-Coredump

This MCP provides a comprehensive interface to systemd-coredump functionality, enabling developers to programmatically access and manage core dumps in Linux environments. It allows listing available coredumps, retrieving detailed metadata about each dump, and extracting core files for analysis. The tool integrates with GDB to generate stack traces and debug information, making it invaluable for post-mortem debugging of crashed applications.

Developers can use this MCP to automate crash analysis workflows, integrate core dump management into CI/CD pipelines, and build monitoring systems that track application stability. It's particularly useful for system administrators maintaining production servers, DevOps engineers troubleshooting distributed systems, and software developers debugging complex crashes that occur in deployed environments.
