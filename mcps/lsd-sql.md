# LSD SQL

LSD SQL MCP provides developers with a powerful domain-specific language for extracting structured data from websites in real-time. This tool enables SQL-like queries against web content, allowing you to scrape, filter, and transform HTML data as if it were a traditional database. The MCP handles the complexities of web scraping, including DOM parsing, element selection, and data normalization, while providing a familiar SQL interface for data extraction.

Developers can use LSD SQL to build web scraping pipelines, monitor website changes, extract product information from e-commerce sites, gather news articles, or perform competitive analysis. The real-time capabilities make it ideal for applications requiring fresh data, such as price monitoring, content aggregation, or automated research tools. By abstracting away the underlying web scraping complexities, LSD SQL enables rapid development of data extraction workflows with minimal boilerplate code.
