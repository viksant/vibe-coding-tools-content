# Tox Testing

This MCP enables developers to execute tox commands to run automated tests within Python projects using the project's tox.ini configuration file. It provides seamless integration with tox's testing framework, allowing you to run tests across multiple Python environments, manage dependencies, and execute various testing commands without manual configuration.

Developers can use this MCP to streamline their testing workflows by automating test execution across different Python versions and environments. It supports running specific test environments, parallel testing, and custom tox commands, making it ideal for CI/CD pipelines, quality assurance processes, and maintaining code quality across complex Python projects with diverse dependency requirements.
