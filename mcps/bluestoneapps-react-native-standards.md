# BluestoneApps React Native Standards

This MCP provides developers with programmatic access to BluestoneApps' comprehensive React Native coding standards and implementation examples through a FastAPI-based interface. Developers can retrieve specific guidelines, best practices, and code patterns via HTTP endpoints, ensuring consistent application architecture and coding quality across React Native projects.

The service enables teams to maintain standardized development practices by offering real-time access to up-to-date guidelines covering component patterns, state management approaches, testing methodologies, and performance optimization techniques. This eliminates the need for manual documentation lookup and helps onboard new developers quickly by providing concrete implementation examples that follow established organizational standards.
