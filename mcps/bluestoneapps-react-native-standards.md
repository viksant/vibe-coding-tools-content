This MCP gives developers easy access to BluestoneApps' detailed React Native coding standards and implementation examples through a FastAPI-based interface.

With this setup, developers can grab specific guidelines, coding practices, and code patterns using simple HTTP endpoints. This approach helps keep the application architecture and coding quality consistent across all React Native projects.

The service supports teams in maintaining standardized development practices by providing real-time access to the latest guidelines. These cover everything from component patterns and state management to testing methods and performance techniques.

This saves time by removing the hassle of searching through manual documentation. Plus, it helps new developers get up to speed quickly with clear implementation examples that align with the organization's established standards.
