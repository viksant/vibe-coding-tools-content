This MCP brings a new level of semantic search to your documentation sources by using vector embeddings and similarity matching.

Here's how it works: it takes your text documents and converts them into high-dimensional vectors that truly capture their meaning. This means developers can locate relevant information based on concepts rather than just keywords. As a result, you get search results that are not only more accurate but also contextually relevant, whether you're sifting through technical documentation, API references, or codebase details.

The tool also supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. It provides precise document retrieval that can ground AI responses in specific, trustworthy sources.

Developers can leverage this feature to create smart documentation assistants, improve code completion with relevant examples, or build context-aware support systems that link directly to official documentation. This saves time by reducing the need for manual searches and ensures that responses come from reliable sources.
