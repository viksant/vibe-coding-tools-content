# RAG Documentation Search

This MCP enables semantic search capabilities across documentation sources using vector embeddings and similarity matching. It transforms text documents into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic meaning, allowing developers to find relevant information based on conceptual similarity rather than just keyword matching. This approach provides more accurate and contextually relevant results when searching through technical documentation, API references, or codebase documentation.

The tool supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows by providing precise document retrieval that can be used to ground AI responses in specific, verifiable sources. Developers can use this to build intelligent documentation assistants, enhance code completion with relevant examples, or create context-aware support systems that reference official documentation. This eliminates the need for manual documentation searching and ensures responses are backed by authoritative sources.
