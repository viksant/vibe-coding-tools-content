# Cloud Foundry Butler

Cloud Foundry Butler is an MCP server that provides automated cleanup capabilities for Cloud Foundry environments. It helps developers and platform operators identify and remove stale applications, services, and other resources that are no longer in active use but continue to consume valuable infrastructure resources. This automation ensures Cloud Foundry foundations remain clean, efficient, and cost-effective by eliminating resource bloat and reducing operational overhead.

The MCP enables systematic cleanup workflows through scheduled scans, policy-based deletion rules, and safety checks to prevent accidental removal of active resources. Common use cases include cleaning up development environments after feature branches are merged, removing temporary test applications, and managing service instances from completed projects. By integrating with Cloud Foundry's API, it provides a programmatic way to maintain organizational hygiene and optimize platform performance across large-scale deployments.
