Cloud Foundry Butler acts as your automated cleanup helper for Cloud Foundry environments. Think of it as a tool that helps developers and platform operators spot and remove stale applications, services, and other resources that are no longer in use but still take up valuable infrastructure space.

With this automation, Cloud Foundry stays clean and cost-effective. By clearing out unnecessary resources, it helps reduce operational overhead and keeps everything running smoothly.

The MCP supports systematic cleanup by scheduling scans, applying policy-based deletion rules, and including safety checks. These checks prevent any accidental removal of resources that are still active.

You can use Cloud Foundry Butler in various scenarios. For instance, itâ€™s great for tidying up development environments after merging feature branches, getting rid of temporary test applications, and managing service instances from completed projects.

Plus, it works seamlessly with Cloud Foundry's API. This integration gives you a programmatic approach to maintain cleanliness and boost platform performance, especially in large-scale environments.
