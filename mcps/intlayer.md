# Intlayer

The Intlayer MCP server provides seamless integration capabilities for developers working with Intlayer's internationalization (i18n) solution and content management system. It enables programmatic access to localization workflows, content management operations, and internationalization features through standardized MCP protocols. This server acts as a bridge between development tools and Intlayer's ecosystem, allowing for automated content synchronization, locale management, and translation workflows.

Developers can leverage this MCP to build sophisticated i18n pipelines, integrate localization into CI/CD processes, and create custom tooling around Intlayer's content management capabilities. Use cases include automated documentation generation with multi-language support, CLI tools for managing translations, and SDK integrations that dynamically handle localized content. The server simplifies complex internationalization tasks by providing a unified interface for content operations, translation management, and locale-specific configuration across different development environments.
