# TTS Say

The TTS Say MCP provides seamless text-to-speech conversion capabilities by integrating with OpenAI's advanced TTS API and local sound playback systems. This enables developers to add natural-sounding voice output to their applications, from interactive assistants and accessibility tools to audio notifications and multimedia content generation.

With this MCP, developers can programmatically generate high-quality speech from text inputs, customize voice parameters, and manage audio playback across different platforms. The integration supports both cloud-based synthesis through OpenAI's robust API and local audio handling, making it suitable for real-time applications, offline scenarios, and scalable voice solutions that enhance user experience through auditory feedback.
