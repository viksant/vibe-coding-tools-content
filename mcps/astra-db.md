# Astra DB

This MCP provides seamless integration with Astra DB, DataStax's cloud-native database built on Apache Cassandra. It enables developers to perform comprehensive database operations including data storage, retrieval, querying, and management directly within their AI workflows. The server handles authentication, connection management, and API interactions, abstracting away the complexity of direct database communication.

By leveraging Astra DB's distributed architecture, this MCP supports building highly scalable AI applications that require reliable, low-latency data access. Developers can efficiently manage large datasets, implement real-time data pipelines, and ensure data consistency across distributed AI systems. The integration is particularly valuable for applications needing persistent storage for AI model metadata, training data management, or real-time inference results logging.
