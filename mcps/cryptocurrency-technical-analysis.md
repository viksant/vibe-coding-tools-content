# Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis

This MCP server provides comprehensive cryptocurrency technical analysis capabilities by calculating 12 and 26-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for Binance trading pairs in real-time. It leverages MongoDB-stored OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data to deliver accurate technical indicators that help traders identify market trends and make informed trading decisions. The system processes live market data through Server-Sent Events, ensuring low-latency analysis for time-sensitive trading strategies.

Developers can integrate this MCP to build automated trading bots, portfolio management tools, and market analysis dashboards. The real-time EMA calculations enable trend identification, momentum analysis, and trading signal generation. By providing reliable technical indicators through a standardized API, this MCP empowers developers to create sophisticated cryptocurrency trading applications without building complex data processing pipelines from scratch.
