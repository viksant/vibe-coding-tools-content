This MCP server offers powerful tools for analyzing cryptocurrencies by calculating the 12 and 26-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for Binance trading pairs in real time.

It uses data stored in MongoDB, specifically the Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) information, to provide accurate technical indicators. These indicators help traders spot market trends and make well-informed trading choices. With Server-Sent Events, the system processes live market data, ensuring quick analysis for those time-sensitive trading strategies.

Developers can easily integrate this MCP into their projects to create automated trading bots, manage portfolios, and develop market analysis dashboards.

The real-time EMA calculations support trend identification, momentum analysis, and trading signal generation. By offering reliable technical indicators through a standardized API, this MCP allows developers to build advanced cryptocurrency trading applications without the hassle of creating complex data processing systems from the ground up.
