# OpenMetadata

The OpenMetadata MCP server provides a powerful interface for interacting with OpenMetadata's unified metadata platform. It enables developers to programmatically query, update, and manage metadata across diverse data assets including databases, dashboards, pipelines, and ML models. This integration supports comprehensive data governance workflows, automated cataloging, and end-to-end lineage tracking.

By leveraging this MCP, teams can automate metadata management tasks, enforce data quality standards, and maintain accurate data lineage documentation. Use cases include automated data discovery, policy enforcement, impact analysis for schema changes, and generating compliance reports. The server bridges the gap between OpenMetadata's rich metadata capabilities and development workflows, making metadata a first-class citizen in data engineering and analytics pipelines.
