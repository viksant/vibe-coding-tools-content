The OpenMetadata MCP server offers a user-friendly way to connect with OpenMetadata's unified metadata platform. It allows developers to easily query, update, and manage metadata across a wide range of data assets, such as databases, dashboards, pipelines, and machine learning models.

This integration streamlines data governance workflows, automates cataloging, and provides complete lineage tracking from start to finish.

With the MCP, teams can take care of metadata management tasks automatically, enforce data quality standards, and keep accurate documentation of data lineage. Some practical uses include automated data discovery, policy enforcement, analyzing the impact of schema changes, and creating compliance reports.

This server effectively links OpenMetadata's extensive metadata features with development processes, ensuring that metadata plays a crucial role in data engineering and analytics pipelines.
