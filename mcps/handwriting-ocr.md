This MCP connects with a Handwriting OCR API, allowing you to extract and digitize text from handwritten documents in different image formats. With this tool, developers can turn physical notes, manuscripts, and scanned documents into editable and searchable text. This makes data entry and archiving a breeze.

It supports various image formats and delivers accurate text recognition for handwritten material. 

Developers can harness this MCP to create applications that automate document processing, build digital archives from historical manuscripts, or design note-taking apps that transform handwritten notes into digital text.

The API can handle different handwriting styles and variations, making it perfect for educational, archival, and business applications where turning handwritten content into digital format is essential.
