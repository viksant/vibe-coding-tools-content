# SCAST

SCAST is a powerful static code analysis tool that helps developers understand and document complex codebases through automated visualization. By simply providing a folder path, SCAST performs comprehensive code analysis to generate various visual representations including UML diagrams, abstract syntax tree (AST) visualizations, and Mermaid flowcharts. This enables developers to quickly grasp code architecture, identify patterns, and document system designs without manual diagramming.

The tool is particularly valuable for onboarding new team members, conducting code reviews, and maintaining documentation for evolving projects. It supports multiple programming languages and provides both high-level architectural overviews and detailed code structure insights, making it an essential tool for teams working on large or legacy codebases where visual understanding accelerates development and maintenance workflows.
