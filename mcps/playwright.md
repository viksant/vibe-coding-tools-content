# Playwright

This MCP server brings Playwright's powerful browser automation capabilities to Claude, allowing developers to automate complex web interactions through natural language. With this integration, you can programmatically control Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers to perform tasks like filling forms, clicking buttons, navigating pages, and extracting data from dynamic web applications.

The Playwright MCP enables automated testing of web applications across multiple browsers, web scraping from JavaScript-heavy sites, and automated content submission workflows. It handles modern web technologies including single-page applications, shadow DOM, and iframes, making it ideal for testing complex user interfaces, generating content through web interfaces, and building data extraction pipelines from dynamic websites.
