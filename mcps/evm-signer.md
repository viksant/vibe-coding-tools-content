# EVM Signer

The EVM Signer MCP provides developers with a secure, local interface for Ethereum blockchain operations, enabling wallet management, transaction execution, and smart contract interactions via Infura's reliable node infrastructure. This tool abstracts the complexity of direct blockchain communication while maintaining security by keeping private keys local and never exposing them to external services.

Developers can use this MCP to streamline dApp development workflows, including automated testing of smart contracts, batch transaction processing, and integration with existing development tools. It's particularly valuable for building decentralized applications, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms that require programmatic access to Ethereum functionality without compromising security or requiring extensive blockchain infrastructure setup.
