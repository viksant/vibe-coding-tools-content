# Mixpanel

This MCP provides seamless integration with Mixpanel's powerful analytics platform, allowing developers to programmatically access and analyze user behavior data. It enables querying of event data, calculating retention metrics, and building custom funnels directly through code, making it ideal for automating analytics workflows and generating real-time insights.

Developers can leverage this integration to create custom dashboards, automate reporting processes, and embed analytics directly into their applications. The MCP supports complex queries and aggregations, enabling teams to track user journeys, measure product performance, and make data-driven decisions without manual intervention in the Mixpanel UI.
