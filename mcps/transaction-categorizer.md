# Transaction Categorizer

The Transaction Categorizer MCP processes raw financial transaction data and automatically categorizes it into predefined expense and income categories. It analyzes transaction descriptions, amounts, and metadata to intelligently assign categories like groceries, utilities, entertainment, or salary income. This automation saves significant manual effort in personal finance tracking and ensures consistent categorization across all transactions.

The tool outputs clean, organized CSV files that are ready for import into personal finance software, spreadsheets, or custom applications. This enables developers to build automated expense tracking systems, financial dashboards, and budgeting tools. Use cases include personal finance apps, expense reporting systems, financial analytics platforms, and automated bookkeeping solutions that require structured transaction data.
