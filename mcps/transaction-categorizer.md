The Transaction Categorizer MCP takes raw financial transaction data and sorts it into clear expense and income categories automatically. 

It looks at transaction descriptions, amounts, and metadata to smartly label categories such as groceries, utilities, entertainment, or salary income. By automating this process, it reduces the time you spend on tracking personal finances and keeps your categorization consistent for every transaction.

Once the categorization is done, the tool provides neat, organized CSV files, making it easy to import the data into personal finance software, spreadsheets, or custom applications. 

This feature opens the door for developers to create automated expense tracking systems, financial dashboards, and budgeting tools. You can find this useful in personal finance apps, expense reporting systems, financial analytics platforms, and automated bookkeeping solutions that need structured transaction data.
