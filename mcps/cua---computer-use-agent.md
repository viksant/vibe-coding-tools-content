The CUA MCP server offers a way to access virtual macOS environments asynchronously, tailored for Apple Silicon architecture through Apple's Virtualization.framework.

This setup allows AI models and development tools to run automation workflows in secure, isolated sandbox environments. You get all the benefits of macOS without compromising security.

Plus, the server works seamlessly with popular MCP clients, such as Cursor and Claude Desktop. Developers can easily build and test automation scripts, perform system operations, and create intricate workflow automationsâ€”all without impacting the host system.
