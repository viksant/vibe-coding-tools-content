The CUA MCP server provides asynchronous access to virtual macOS environments using Apple's Virtualization.framework, specifically designed for Apple Silicon architecture. 

It enables AI models and development tools to execute computer automation workflows in isolated sandbox environments, ensuring security while maintaining full macOS functionality. 

This server supports popular MCP clients like Cursor and Claude Desktop, allowing developers to build and test automation scripts, perform system operations, and create complex workflow automations without affecting the host system.
