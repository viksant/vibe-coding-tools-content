# iMessage

The iMessage MCP enables developers to programmatically interact with Apple's iMessage service on macOS systems. This tool provides read and send capabilities, allowing automation of messaging workflows directly from development environments. Developers can build applications that monitor incoming messages, send automated responses, or integrate iMessage functionality into larger automation systems.

Use cases include automated notifications for CI/CD pipelines, chatbot integrations, testing communication flows, and building custom messaging tools. The MCP handles the underlying macOS integration while providing a clean API interface, making iMessage functionality accessible without deep system-level knowledge. This is particularly valuable for teams building macOS-specific automation or communication tools that need to leverage Apple's native messaging platform.
