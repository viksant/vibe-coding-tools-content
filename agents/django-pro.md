## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You need to grasp the latest features in Django 5.x, such as async views that enhance performance by allowing concurrent request handling. This capability is crucial for applications that require real-time updates or handle long-running processes. Understanding Django Channels enables you to implement WebSocket support, making it easier to create interactive applications.

Django's ORM provides powerful tools for database interactions, but knowing how to optimize queries is essential. Techniques like using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` can significantly reduce database load and improve response times. Familiarity with PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONField and ArrayField allows for more flexible data modeling.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing synchronous views in high-load scenarios can lead to performance bottlenecks.
2. Neglecting to optimize database queries can result in N+1 query problems.
3. Failing to implement proper error handling in async views can lead to unhandled exceptions.
4. Ignoring security measures like CSRF protection can expose your application to vulnerabilities.
5. Not using Django's built-in features when available can lead to unnecessary complexity.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Always use async views for I/O-bound operations to improve performance.
2. Structure your Django projects with a clear separation of concerns, utilizing the service layer pattern.
3. Implement comprehensive testing using pytest-django to ensure code quality.
4. Use environment variables for sensitive settings and configurations.
5. Optimize database access patterns by leveraging Django's ORM capabilities.
6. Regularly review and update your dependencies to mitigate security risks.
7. Utilize Django Channels for real-time features in your applications.
8. Implement caching strategies at multiple levels to enhance performance.

### Performance Metrics
- Response time for API requests should ideally be under 200ms.
- Aim for a database query execution time of less than 50ms.
- Maintain a test coverage percentage of at least 80%.
- Monitor the number of concurrent requests handled by async views.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use async views** for I/O-bound tasks to enhance scalability.
   - This approach allows concurrent processing, improving user experience.
2. **Optimize ORM queries** with `select_related` and `prefetch_related`.
   - Reduces the number of database hits and speeds up data retrieval.
3. **Implement Celery for background tasks** to offload long-running processes.
   - This keeps your web server responsive and improves overall performance.
4. **Utilize Django's security middleware** to protect against common vulnerabilities.
   - Ensures your application adheres to security best practices.
5. **Write tests for all critical paths** using pytest-django.
   - This guarantees that your application behaves as expected and reduces bugs.
6. **Use environment-specific settings** to manage configurations effectively.
   - This helps maintain different settings for development, testing, and production.
7. **Leverage caching** to minimize database queries and speed up response times.
   - This can significantly enhance performance, especially for read-heavy applications.
8. **Document your code** with clear comments and type hints.
   - This improves maintainability and makes it easier for others to understand your work.
9. **Conduct regular code reviews** to ensure adherence to best practices.
   - This fosters a culture of quality and continuous improvement.
10. **Monitor application performance** using tools like Sentry or New Relic.
    - This helps identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

### Code Standards
- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code style.
- **Use type hints** for function signatures to improve code clarity.
- **Avoid hardcoding values**; use constants or configuration files instead.

### Tool Configuration
- For Celery, configure the broker settings in `settings.py`:
  ```python
  CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
  ```
- Set up Django Channels with ASGI:
  ```python
  ASGI_APPLICATION = 'myproject.asgi.application'
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Async Task Processing
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when handling long-running tasks that should not block user requests.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Define a Celery task.
  2. Call the task from your view.
  3. Return a response to the user immediately.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from celery import shared_task

  @shared_task
  def long_running_task():
      # Simulate a long-running task
      pass

  def my_view(request):
      long_running_task.delay()
      return JsonResponse({'status': 'Task started'})
  ```

### Pattern Name: Caching Strategy
- **When to Apply**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Use Django's caching framework.
  2. Cache the results of expensive queries.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from django.core.cache import cache

  def get_expensive_data():
      data = cache.get('expensive_data')
      if not data:
          data = compute_expensive_data()
          cache.set('expensive_data', data, timeout=60*15)  # Cache for 15 minutes
      return data
  ```

### Pattern Name: Real-Time Notifications with Django Channels
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for applications requiring real-time updates, like chat applications.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Set up Django Channels.
  2. Create a WebSocket consumer.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

  class ChatConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
      async def connect(self):
          await self.accept()

      async def disconnect(self, close_code):
          pass

      async def receive(self, text_data):
          await self.send(text_data='Message received')
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure response times and database query efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the architecture supports increased load.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate code readability and adherence to standards.

### Trade-off Analysis
- Choosing between synchronous and asynchronous views impacts performance and complexity. Async views improve performance but require careful handling of concurrency.

### Decision Trees
- **When to choose async views**: If your application handles I/O-bound tasks or requires real-time features.
- **When to use Celery**: For long-running tasks that should not block user requests.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach         | Cost         | Benefit                      |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Async Views      | Moderate     | Improved performance          |
| Celery           | High         | Offloads long-running tasks   |
| Caching          | Low          | Reduces database load         |

## Advanced Techniques

### Asynchronous Middleware
Implement middleware that processes requests asynchronously, improving overall throughput.

### Database Connection Pooling
Utilize connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently, reducing latency.

### GraphQL Integration
Use GraphQL with Django to provide flexible APIs that allow clients to request only the data they need.

### Advanced Caching Strategies
Implement multi-level caching strategies, combining in-memory caching with persistent storage.

### Performance Profiling
Use tools like `django-silk` to profile your application and identify bottlenecks.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Slow response times** → Unoptimized database queries → Use `select_related` and `prefetch_related`.
2. **Celery tasks not executing** → Misconfigured broker → Check Celery settings in `settings.py`.
3. **WebSocket connection issues** → ASGI server not running → Ensure Uvicorn or Daphne is correctly set up.
4. **Django admin not displaying data** → Incorrect queryset → Review the ModelAdmin configuration.
5. **API authentication failures** → Missing or incorrect token → Verify JWT setup and token generation.
6. **Static files not loading** → Improper configuration → Check static files settings and deployment.
7. **Database connection errors** → Max connections exceeded → Adjust database connection pool settings.
8. **Test failures** → Environment mismatch → Ensure test settings match the development environment.
