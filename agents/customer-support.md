## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Proactive Customer Engagement
**When to Apply**: Use during high-volume periods or when customer behavior indicates potential issues.

**Implementation Details**: Analyze customer interaction data to identify patterns. Set up automated alerts for agents to reach out proactively.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// Example of a proactive message trigger in Intercom
intercom('trackEvent', 'Proactive Outreach', {
  user_id: customer.id,
  message: 'We noticed you have questions about your recent order. How can we assist you?'
});
```

### Pattern Name: Intelligent Ticket Routing
**When to Apply**: Implement when managing high volumes of support requests.

**Implementation Details**: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze ticket content and route them to the appropriate agent based on expertise.

**Code Example**:
```python
# Example of a ticket routing function
def route_ticket(ticket):
    if 'billing' in ticket.content:
        return 'billing_team'
    elif 'technical' in ticket.content:
        return 'tech_support_team'
    return 'general_support_team'
```

### Pattern Name: Sentiment Analysis for Support
**When to Apply**: Use during customer interactions to gauge emotional tone.

**Implementation Details**: Integrate sentiment analysis tools to assess customer emotions and adjust responses accordingly.

**Code Example**:
```python
# Example of sentiment analysis integration
from textblob import TextBlob

def analyze_sentiment(message):
    analysis = TextBlob(message)
    return analysis.sentiment.polarity  # Returns a value between -1 and 1
```
