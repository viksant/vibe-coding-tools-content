## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Component composition is a critical aspect of modern front-end frameworks. It allows developers to build complex UIs from simple, reusable components. In React, for instance, the use of **higher-order components (HOCs)** and **render props** can facilitate composition by allowing components to share behavior without altering their structure. In Vue, the **slot** mechanism provides a powerful way to create flexible components that can accept dynamic content. Angular leverages **ng-content** for similar purposes, enabling developers to create highly reusable components that can adapt to various contexts.

Understanding the lifecycle of components is also essential. Each framework has its own lifecycle methods that dictate how components are initialized, updated, and destroyed. Mastering these methods allows for better resource management and performance tuning. For example, in React, using `useEffect` correctly can prevent unnecessary re-renders, while in Angular, leveraging `OnPush` change detection strategy can significantly boost performance.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overusing Prop Drilling**: Passing props through many layers can lead to cumbersome code and decreased maintainability.
2. **Neglecting Component Reusability**: Failing to design components with reusability in mind can lead to duplicated code and increased complexity.
3. **Ignoring Performance Metrics**: Not measuring component performance can result in slow applications.
4. **Improper State Management**: Mismanaging state can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
5. **Underutilizing Composition Patterns**: Not leveraging advanced composition patterns can limit the flexibility of your components.
6. **Inconsistent Component Hierarchy**: A poorly structured component hierarchy can make the application difficult to understand and maintain.
7. **Not Validating Prop Types**: Failing to validate prop types can lead to runtime errors and bugs.

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Use Composition Over Inheritance**: Favor composition to create flexible and reusable components.
2. **Implement Prop Types Validation**: Use libraries like PropTypes in React or TypeScript for type safety.
3. **Leverage Slots in Vue**: Utilize slots for creating highly customizable components.
4. **Optimize Rendering**: Use memoization techniques like `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Adopt Compound Component Patterns**: Create compound components to manage complex interactions between components.
6. **Maintain a Flat Component Hierarchy**: Keep the component hierarchy as flat as possible to improve readability and maintainability.
7. **Utilize Context API**: In React, use the Context API to avoid prop drilling.
8. **Embrace Functional Components**: Prefer functional components over class components for better performance and readability.
9. **Keep Components Focused**: Ensure each component has a single responsibility to enhance reusability.
10. **Document Component APIs**: Provide clear documentation for component props and usage.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Measure the time taken for components to render.
- **Re-render Count**: Track how often components re-render.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during component lifecycle.
- **User Interaction Latency**: Assess the responsiveness of components to user interactions.
- **Bundle Size**: Evaluate the impact of components on the overall application bundle size.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Favor Functional Components**: Use functional components for cleaner and more efficient code.
   - *Why*: They are easier to read and test, and they support hooks for state management.
  
2. **Use React.memo for Optimization**: Wrap components with `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - *Why*: This enhances performance by skipping renders when props have not changed.

3. **Implement PropTypes or TypeScript**: Always validate props using PropTypes or TypeScript.
   - *Why*: This helps catch errors early and improves code reliability.

4. **Utilize Context API for State Management**: Use React's Context API to manage global state without prop drilling.
   - *Why*: This simplifies state management and improves component isolation.

5. **Adopt Compound Component Patterns**: Design components that work together as a cohesive unit.
   - *Why*: This increases flexibility and reusability of components.

6. **Keep Components Stateless When Possible**: Prefer stateless components to enhance performance.
   - *Why*: Stateless components are simpler and can be optimized more easily.

7. **Avoid Inline Functions in Render**: Do not define functions inside the render method.
   - *Why*: This can lead to unnecessary re-renders as new function instances are created on each render.

8. **Use Slots for Dynamic Content in Vue**: Leverage slots to create flexible components in Vue.
   - *Why*: This allows components to accept dynamic content, enhancing reusability.

9. **Implement Lazy Loading for Components**: Use dynamic imports to load components only when needed.
   - *Why*: This reduces the initial load time of the application.

10. **Document Component APIs Thoroughly**: Provide clear documentation for each component's API.
    - *Why*: This aids other developers in understanding how to use the components effectively.

11. **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Use tools like React Profiler or Vue DevTools to analyze component performance.
    - *Why*: Regular monitoring helps identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

12. **Structure Components Logically**: Organize components in a way that reflects their relationship and usage.
    - *Why*: This improves maintainability and developer experience.

13. **Use CSS Modules or Styled Components**: Isolate styles to prevent conflicts.
    - *Why*: This enhances the modularity and maintainability of styles.

14. **Test Components in Isolation**: Write unit tests for components to ensure they function correctly.
    - *Why*: This helps catch bugs early and ensures component reliability.

15. **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: Keep render methods pure and free of side effects.
    - *Why*: This ensures predictable behavior and easier debugging.

### Code Standards
- **Component Structure**: Each component should have a clear structure: props, state, lifecycle methods, and render logic.
  
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const MyComponent = ({ title, onClick }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    onClick();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default MyComponent;
```

- **Avoid Anti-patterns**: Do not use class components unless necessary, and avoid deeply nested components.

### Tool Configuration
- **React Configuration**: Ensure Babel is set up to transpile modern JavaScript and JSX.
  
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

- **Vue Configuration**: Use Vue CLI for project setup to ensure best practices are followed.

```bash
vue create my-project
```

- **Angular Configuration**: Use Angular CLI for generating components and services.

```bash
ng generate component my-component
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Compound Component Pattern
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you have a set of components that need to work together to form a cohesive UI.
- **Implementation Details**: Create a parent component that manages the state and passes props to child components.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const Tabs = ({ children }) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => (
          <button onClick={() => setActiveTab(index)}>
            {child.props.label}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
      {React.Children.toArray(children)[activeTab]}
    </div>
  );
};

const Tab = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;

// Usage
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tab 1">Content 1</Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab 2">Content 2</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Pattern Name: Render Props Pattern
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you want to share code between components without using inheritance.
- **Implementation Details**: Pass a function as a prop to a component that returns a React element.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const DataFetcher = ({ render }) => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return render(data);
};

// Usage
<DataFetcher render={data => <div>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}</div>} />
```

### Pattern Name: Higher-Order Component (HOC)
- **When to Apply**: Use HOCs to enhance components with additional functionality.
- **Implementation Details**: Create a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return ({ isLoading, ...props }) => {
    if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};

// Usage
const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure render times and re-render counts.
- **Maintainability**: Assess how easy it is to understand and modify the component.
- **Reusability**: Determine if the component can be reused in different contexts.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Complexity vs. Flexibility**: More complex patterns may offer greater flexibility but can be harder to understand.
- **Performance vs. Readability**: Optimizations may reduce performance but improve readability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Context API vs. Prop Drilling**: Use Context API when multiple components need access to the same data without passing props through many layers.
- **When to Choose HOC vs. Render Props**: Choose HOC for cross-cutting concerns and Render Props for more granular control over rendering.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach               | Cost                        | Benefit                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Prop Drilling         | Increased complexity        | Simple to implement           |
| Context API           | Initial setup complexity    | Reduces prop drilling         |
| Compound Components    | More boilerplate code       | High reusability and flexibility |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Imports for Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports to split code at the component level, reducing initial load times.
   - *Example*: 
   ```javascript
   const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
   ```

2. **Memoization with useMemo**: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations in functional components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
   ```

3. **Custom Hooks for Reusable Logic**: Create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic across components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   const useFetch = (url) => {
     const [data, setData] = useState(null);
     useEffect(() => {
       fetch(url).then(response => response.json()).then(setData);
     }, [url]);
     return data;
   };
   ```

4. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement SSR for improved performance and SEO.
   - *Example*: Use frameworks like Next.js for React to enable SSR.

5. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use SSG for pages that don’t change often to improve performance.
   - *Example*: Use Nuxt.js for Vue to generate static pages.

6. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries in React to catch JavaScript errors in child components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { hasError: false };
     }
     static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
       return { hasError: true };
     }
     componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
       // Log error
     }
     render() {
       if (this.state.hasError) {
         return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
       }
       return this.props.children; 
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Use of CSS-in-JS Libraries**: Leverage libraries like styled-components or Emotion for scoped styling.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   import styled from 'styled-components';
   const Button = styled.button`
     background: blue;
     color: white;
   `;
   ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Symptom**: Component does not render.
   - **Cause**: Incorrect props passed or missing required props.
   - **Solution**: Validate props and ensure all required props are provided.

2. **Symptom**: Performance lag during rendering.
   - **Cause**: Excessive re-renders due to state changes.
   - **Solution**: Use `React.memo` or `shouldComponentUpdate` to control re-renders.

3. **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in state management.
   - **Cause**: Mutating state directly instead of using setState.
   - **Solution**: Always return a new state object.

4. **Symptom**: CSS styles not applying.
   - **Cause**: Specificity issues or styles being overridden.
   - **Solution**: Check CSS specificity and ensure styles are correctly scoped.

5. **Symptom**: Props not updating in child components.
   - **Cause**: Parent component not re-rendering.
   - **Solution**: Ensure state changes in the parent component trigger re-renders.

6. **Symptom**: Console errors related to missing keys.
   - **Cause**: Missing `key` prop in lists.
   - **Solution**: Add a unique `key` prop to each element in lists.

7. **Symptom**: Memory leaks in components.
   - **Cause**: Not cleaning up subscriptions or timers.
   - **Solution**: Use cleanup functions in `useEffect` or componentWillUnmount.

8. **Symptom**: Component hierarchy is difficult to manage.
   - **Cause**: Deeply nested components.
   - **Solution**: Refactor to flatten the component hierarchy.

9. **Symptom**: Inconsistent UI behavior.
   - **Cause**: State being shared improperly between components.
   - **Solution**: Use Context API or Redux for shared state management.

10. **Symptom**: Build fails with errors.
    - **Cause**: Syntax errors or missing dependencies.
    - **Solution**: Review error messages and ensure all dependencies are installed.
