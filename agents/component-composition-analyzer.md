## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Component composition is vital in modern front-end frameworks. It enables developers to build sophisticated UIs from simple, reusable components. For instance, in React, **higher-order components (HOCs)** and **render props** allow components to share behaviors without changing their structure. Vue uses the **slot** mechanism to create flexible components that can accept dynamic content, while Angular utilizes **ng-content** for similar flexibility.

Understanding a component's lifecycle is crucial. Each framework has its lifecycle methods for initializing, updating, and destroying components. Mastering these methods enhances resource management and performance tuning. For example, using `useEffect` properly in React can help avoid unnecessary re-renders, while Angular’s `OnPush` change detection strategy can significantly improve performance.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overusing Prop Drilling**: Passing props through multiple layers can clutter your code and reduce maintainability.
2. **Neglecting Component Reusability**: Designing components without reusability in mind leads to duplicated code and added complexity.
3. **Ignoring Performance Metrics**: Not measuring component performance can slow down your application.
4. **Improper State Management**: Mismanaged state may cause unexpected behavior and bugs.
5. **Underutilizing Composition Patterns**: Not taking advantage of advanced composition patterns limits your components' flexibility.
6. **Inconsistent Component Hierarchy**: A poorly structured hierarchy can make the application hard to understand and maintain.
7. **Not Validating Prop Types**: Failing to validate prop types can result in runtime errors.

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**: This approach creates more flexible and reusable components.
2. **Implement Prop Types Validation**: Use libraries like PropTypes in React or TypeScript to ensure type safety.
3. **Leverage Slots in Vue**: Use slots for highly customizable components.
4. **Optimize Rendering**: Employ memoization techniques like `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Adopt Compound Component Patterns**: Design components that work together seamlessly.
6. **Maintain a Flat Component Hierarchy**: A flat structure improves readability and maintainability.
7. **Utilize Context API**: In React, the Context API helps avoid prop drilling.
8. **Embrace Functional Components**: Functional components improve performance and readability.
9. **Keep Components Focused**: Ensure each component serves a single purpose to boost reusability.
10. **Document Component APIs**: Clear documentation aids developers in understanding how to use components.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Measure how long components take to render.
- **Re-render Count**: Track how often components re-render.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during the component lifecycle.
- **User Interaction Latency**: Check how responsive components are to user interactions.
- **Bundle Size**: Evaluate how components impact the overall application size.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Favor Functional Components**: They offer cleaner and more efficient code.
   - *Why*: They are easier to read, test, and support hooks for managing state.
  
2. **Use React.memo for Optimization**: Wrap components with `React.memo` to skip unnecessary re-renders.
   - *Why*: This boosts performance by avoiding renders when props haven’t changed.

3. **Implement PropTypes or TypeScript**: Always validate props.
   - *Why*: This helps catch errors early, enhancing code reliability.

4. **Utilize Context API for State Management**: Manage global state without prop drilling.
   - *Why*: This simplifies state management and improves component isolation.

5. **Adopt Compound Component Patterns**: Design components that collaborate effectively.
   - *Why*: This enhances flexibility and reusability.

6. **Keep Components Stateless When Possible**: Prefer stateless components for better performance.
   - *Why*: They are simpler and easier to optimize.

7. **Avoid Inline Functions in Render**: Don’t define functions inside the render method.
   - *Why*: This can trigger unnecessary re-renders since new function instances are created on each render.

8. **Use Slots for Dynamic Content in Vue**: Leverage slots to create flexible components.
   - *Why*: This allows components to accept dynamic content, enhancing reusability.

9. **Implement Lazy Loading for Components**: Load components only when needed.
   - *Why*: This reduces the initial load time of the application.

10. **Document Component APIs Thoroughly**: Provide clear documentation for each component's API.
    - *Why*: This helps other developers understand how to use the components effectively.

11. **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Use tools like React Profiler or Vue DevTools to analyze performance.
    - *Why*: Regular monitoring helps identify bottlenecks.

12. **Structure Components Logically**: Organize components to reflect their relationships and usage.
    - *Why*: This improves maintainability.

13. **Use CSS Modules or Styled Components**: Isolate styles to prevent conflicts.
    - *Why*: This increases the modularity and maintainability of styles.

14. **Test Components in Isolation**: Write unit tests for components to ensure functionality.
    - *Why*: This helps catch bugs early.

15. **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: Keep render methods pure.
    - *Why*: This ensures predictable behavior and easier debugging.

### Code Standards
- **Component Structure**: Each component should have a clear structure: props, state, lifecycle methods, and render logic.
  
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const MyComponent = ({ title, onClick }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    onClick();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

MyComponent.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

export default MyComponent;
```

- **Avoid Anti-patterns**: Steer clear of class components unless necessary, and avoid deeply nested components.

### Tool Configuration
- **React Configuration**: Ensure Babel is set up to transpile modern JavaScript and JSX.
  
```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

- **Vue Configuration**: Use Vue CLI for project setup to follow best practices.

```bash
vue create my-project
```

- **Angular Configuration**: Use Angular CLI to generate components and services.

```bash
ng generate component my-component
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Compound Component Pattern
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you have a group of components that need to function together cohesively.
- **Implementation Details**: Create a parent component that manages state and passes props to child components.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const Tabs = ({ children }) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {React.Children.map(children, (child, index) => (
          <button onClick={() => setActiveTab(index)}>
            {child.props.label}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
      {React.Children.toArray(children)[activeTab]}
    </div>
  );
};

const Tab = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;

// Usage
<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Tab 1">Content 1</Tab>
  <Tab label="Tab 2">Content 2</Tab>
</Tabs>
```

### Pattern Name: Render Props Pattern
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you want to share code between components without using inheritance.
- **Implementation Details**: Pass a function as a prop to a component that returns a React element.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const DataFetcher = ({ render }) => {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return render(data);
};

// Usage
<DataFetcher render={data => <div>{data ? data : 'Loading...'}</div>} />
```

### Pattern Name: Higher-Order Component (HOC)
- **When to Apply**: Use HOCs to enhance components with extra functionality.
- **Implementation Details**: Create a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return ({ isLoading, ...props }) => {
    if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};

// Usage
const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure render times and re-render counts.
- **Maintainability**: Assess how easy it is to understand and modify the component.
- **Reusability**: Determine if the component can be reused in different contexts.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Complexity vs. Flexibility**: More complex patterns may offer greater flexibility but can be harder to understand.
- **Performance vs. Readability**: Optimizations may improve performance but reduce readability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Context API vs. Prop Drilling**: Opt for the Context API when multiple components need access to the same data without excessive prop passing.
- **When to Choose HOC vs. Render Props**: Select HOCs for cross-cutting concerns and Render Props for more granular control over rendering.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach               | Cost                        | Benefit                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Prop Drilling         | Increased complexity        | Simple to implement           |
| Context API           | Initial setup complexity    | Reduces prop drilling         |
| Compound Components    | More boilerplate code       | High reusability and flexibility |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Imports for Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports to split code at the component level, reducing initial load times.
   - *Example*: 
   ```javascript
   const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));
   ```

2. **Memoization with useMemo**: Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations in functional components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
   ```

3. **Custom Hooks for Reusable Logic**: Create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic across components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   const useFetch = (url) => {
     const [data, setData] = useState(null);
     useEffect(() => {
       fetch(url).then(response => response.json()).then(setData);
     }, [url]);
     return data;
   };
   ```

4. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement SSR for improved performance and SEO.
   - *Example*: Use frameworks like Next.js for React to enable SSR.

5. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Use SSG for pages that don’t change often to enhance performance.
   - *Example*: Use Nuxt.js for Vue to generate static pages.

6. **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries in React to catch JavaScript errors in child components.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { hasError: false };
     }
     static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
       return { hasError: true };
     }
     componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
       // Log error
     }
     render() {
       if (this.state.hasError) {
         return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
       }
       return this.props.children; 
     }
   }
   ```

7. **Use of CSS-in-JS Libraries**: Leverage libraries like styled-components or Emotion for scoped styling.
   - *Example*:
   ```javascript
   import styled from 'styled-components';
   const Button = styled.button`
     background: blue;
     color: white;
   `;
   ```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Symptom**: Component does not render.
   - **Cause**: Incorrect props passed or missing required props.
   - **Solution**: Validate props and ensure all required props are provided.

2. **Symptom**: Performance lag during rendering.
   - **Cause**: Excessive re-renders due to state changes.
   - **Solution**: Use `React.memo` or `shouldComponentUpdate` to control re-renders.

3. **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in state management.
   - **Cause**: Mutating state directly instead of using setState.
   - **Solution**: Always return a new state object.

4. **Symptom**: CSS styles not applying.
   - **Cause**: Specificity issues or styles being overridden.
   - **Solution**: Check CSS specificity and ensure styles are correctly scoped.

5. **Symptom**: Props not updating in child components.
   - **Cause**: Parent component not re-rendering.
   - **Solution**: Ensure state changes in the parent component trigger re-renders.

6. **Symptom**: Console errors related to missing keys.
   - **Cause**: Missing `key` prop in lists.
   - **Solution**: Add a unique `key` prop to each element in lists.

7. **Symptom**: Memory leaks in components.
   - **Cause**: Not cleaning up subscriptions or timers.
   - **Solution**: Use cleanup functions in `useEffect` or componentWillUnmount.

8. **Symptom**: Component hierarchy is difficult to manage.
   - **Cause**: Deeply nested components.
   - **Solution**: Refactor to flatten the component hierarchy.

9. **Symptom**: Inconsistent UI behavior.
   - **Cause**: State being shared improperly between components.
   - **Solution**: Use Context API or Redux for shared state management.

10. **Symptom**: Build fails with errors.
    - **Cause**: Syntax errors or missing dependencies.
    - **Solution**: Review error messages and ensure all dependencies are installed.
