## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Customer Churn Prediction
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to identify customers at risk of leaving.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Gather historical customer data, including usage patterns and demographics.
2. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Select relevant features for the predictive model.
4. Train a classification model (e.g., logistic regression) on the data.
5. Validate the model using a holdout dataset to ensure accuracy.

**Code Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Select features and target
X = data[['usage', 'demographics']]
y = data['churn']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)}')
```

### Pattern Name: KPI Dashboard Creation
**When to Apply**: Implement this pattern when you need to visualize key business metrics.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Identify the KPIs that align with business objectives.
2. Design a wireframe for the dashboard layout.
3. Connect to the data source and set up data extracts.
4. Create visualizations for each KPI using charts and graphs.
5. Add interactivity to allow users to drill down into the data.

**Code Example**:
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(sales) AS total_sales,
    AVG(customer_rating) AS average_rating
FROM 
    sales_data
WHERE 
    sale_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    product_category;
```

### Pattern Name: Financial Forecasting Model
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern for predicting future revenue based on historical data.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Collect historical sales data and relevant economic indicators.
2. Choose a forecasting method (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing).
3. Fit the model to historical data and validate its accuracy.
4. Generate forecasts for the desired future period.

**Code Example**:
```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=True)

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['sales'], order=(5, 1, 0))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast future sales
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=12)
print(forecast)
```
