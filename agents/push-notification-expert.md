## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: User Engagement Re-activation
- **When to Apply**: Target users who haven’t interacted with the app for a specified time (e.g., 30 days).
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Identify inactive users through analytics.
  2. Create a personalized notification with a discount or new feature.
  3. Schedule the notification for optimal times based on user behavior.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const sendReactivationNotification = (user) => {
  const payload = {
    to: user.deviceToken,
    notification: {
      title: "We Miss You!",
      body: "Come back and enjoy 20% off your next purchase.",
      click_action: "FLUTTER_NOTIFICATION_CLICK"
