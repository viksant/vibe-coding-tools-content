## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Load balancing plays a vital role in distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed. Techniques like **round-robin**, **least connections**, and **IP hash** help decide how requests are routed. Advanced setups may include **session persistence**, which keeps user sessions on the same server for a better user experience.

In cloud settings, services like **AWS ELB** offer automatic load balancing that works well with other AWS products. Knowing the details of these services, including **health checks** that monitor server availability, is crucial for keeping applications running smoothly.

Also, modern load balancers like **Envoy** come with features such as service discovery, traffic shadowing, and circuit breaking, which are essential for microservices architectures. These capabilities allow for precise control over traffic management and can greatly enhance resilience and performance.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Health Checks**: Skipping proper health checks can lead to routing traffic to unhealthy servers, resulting in downtime.
2. **Overlooking Session Management**: Not setting up session affinity can disrupt user experiences, especially in applications that rely on session data.
3. **Neglecting SSL Termination**: Misconfiguring SSL termination can create security risks and performance issues.
4. **Underestimating Traffic Patterns**: Failing to analyze traffic patterns may lead to inefficient resource allocation and performance bottlenecks.
5. **Inadequate Failover Planning**: Not preparing for failover scenarios can lead to extended downtime during outages.
6. **Using Default Configurations**: Relying on out-of-the-box settings without fine-tuning can limit performance.
7. **Ignoring Logging and Monitoring**: Skipping logging can complicate troubleshooting and hide performance issues.

### Industry Best Practices

frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    acl is_static path_beg /static /images /css
    use_backend static_servers if is_static
    default_backend app_servers

backend app_servers
    balance roundrobin
    server app1 192.168.1.1:80 check
    server app2 192.168.1.2:80 check

backend static_servers
    server static1 192.168.1.3:80 check
```
- **NGINX Configuration Example**:
```nginx
http {
    upstream app_servers {
        server app1.example.com;
        server app2.example.com;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://app_servers;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        }
    }
}
```

### Tool Configuration
- **AWS ELB Configuration**: Ensure health checks check the `/health` endpoint every 30 seconds with a timeout of 5 seconds.
- **Cloudflare Settings**: Enable "Always Online" and "Automatic HTTPS Rewrites" for better performance and security.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Active-Passive Failover
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for critical applications where uptime is essential, and you want to minimize downtime during failover.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set up two identical environments (primary and secondary).
  2. Configure the load balancer to send traffic to the primary environment.
  3. Implement health checks to monitor the primary environment.
  4. In case of a failure, redirect traffic to the secondary environment.
- **Code Example**: 
```haproxy
backend primary_servers
    server primary1 192.168.1.1:80 check
    server primary2 192.168.1.2:80 check

backend secondary_servers
    server secondary1 192.168.1.3:80 check backup
```

### Pattern Name: Session Stickiness
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for applications that need users to maintain state across multiple requests, like e-commerce sites.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Configure the load balancer to use cookies for session persistence.
  2. Ensure that all requests from a user go to the same backend server.
- **Code Example**:
```haproxy
frontend http_front
    bind *:80
    acl is_session_cookie req.cook(session_id) -m found
    use_backend app_servers if is_session_cookie
    default_backend app_servers

backend app_servers
    cookie SESSIONID insert indirect nocache
    server app1 192.168.1.1:80 check
    server app2 192.168.1.2:80 check
```

### Pattern Name: Traffic Splitting
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when rolling out new features and you want to test them with a select group of users.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Configure the load balancer to route a percentage of traffic to the new version of the application.
  2. Monitor performance and user feedback before a full rollout.
- **Code Example**:
```haproxy
backend new_version
    server new_app 192.168.1.4:80 check weight 20
backend old_version
    server old_app 192.168.1.5:80 check weight 80
```
