## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You understand the principles of RESTful API design, including the importance of statelessness and resource-based URIs. You emphasize designing APIs that are intuitive and easy to consume. You also recognize the significance of versioning in APIs, allowing for backward compatibility while introducing new features.

When defining microservice boundaries, you apply the Single Responsibility Principle. Each service should handle a specific business capability, which simplifies maintenance and enhances scalability. You also consider inter-service communication patterns, choosing between synchronous and asynchronous methods based on use cases.

Database schema design is another area where you excel. You focus on normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. You also implement indexing strategies to optimize query performance and consider sharding for handling large datasets.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring API Versioning**: Failing to version APIs can lead to breaking changes for clients.
2. **Overcomplicating Service Boundaries**: Creating too many microservices can complicate deployment and management.
3. **Neglecting Caching**: Not implementing caching can lead to performance bottlenecks under load.
4. **Poorly Designed Database Schemas**: Skipping normalization can cause data anomalies and inefficiencies.
5. **Inadequate Security Measures**: Overlooking authentication and authorization can expose services to vulnerabilities.
6. **Failing to Plan for Scalability**: Not considering horizontal scaling from the start can lead to significant refactoring later.
7. **Not Monitoring Performance**: Ignoring performance metrics can result in undetected bottlenecks.

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Design APIs Contract-First**: Use OpenAPI specifications to define API contracts before implementation.
2. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse by limiting the number of requests from clients.
3. **Use Asynchronous Communication**: Employ message queues for inter-service communication to decouple services.
4. **Apply Caching Strategically**: Use in-memory caches like Redis to reduce database load.
5. **Conduct Regular Performance Reviews**: Analyze system performance regularly to identify bottlenecks.
6. **Utilize CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment processes to ensure consistent delivery.
7. **Document APIs Thoroughly**: Provide clear documentation to facilitate API consumption by developers.
8. **Monitor API Usage**: Track usage patterns to inform scaling decisions and feature enhancements.

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: Measure the time taken to respond to API requests.
- **Throughput**: Track the number of requests handled per second.
- **Error Rate**: Monitor the percentage of failed requests.
- **Latency**: Assess the delay in processing requests.
- **Resource Utilization**: Analyze CPU and memory usage to identify performance issues.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Define Clear API Contracts**: Use OpenAPI specifications to create clear contracts for your APIs.
2. **Version APIs**: Always include versioning in your API endpoints to manage changes gracefully.
3. **Use RESTful Principles**: Follow REST principles such as statelessness and resource-based URIs.
4. **Implement Authentication**: Use OAuth or JWT for secure API access.
5. **Optimize Database Queries**: Analyze and optimize slow queries to improve performance.
6. **Employ Caching**: Use caching mechanisms to reduce load on databases and speed up responses.
7. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Regularly track key performance indicators to identify issues.
8. **Plan for Scalability**: Design systems with horizontal scaling in mind from the beginning.
9. **Document Everything**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for APIs and services.
10. **Conduct Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure adherence to standards and best practices.

### Code Standards
- **API Endpoint Structure**: Follow a consistent structure for defining endpoints. For example:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/v1/users', (req, res) => {
      // Fetch users logic
  });
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling to manage exceptions:
  ```javascript
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
  });
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Express Configuration**: Set up middleware for parsing JSON and handling CORS:
  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const cors = require('cors');
  const app = express();

  app.use(cors());
  app.use(express.json());
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: API Gateway
**When to Apply**: Use an API Gateway when you have multiple microservices that need a unified entry point.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Set up an API Gateway using tools like Kong or AWS API Gateway.
2. Route requests to appropriate microservices based on the endpoint.
3. Implement security features like authentication and rate limiting at the gateway level.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const request = require('request');

app.use('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    request('http://user-service/api/users', (error, response, body) => {
        res.send(body);
    });
});
```

### Pattern Name: Circuit Breaker
**When to Apply**: Implement a Circuit Breaker pattern when dealing with unreliable services to prevent cascading failures.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Use libraries like `opossum` to wrap service calls.
2. Define thresholds for failure rates to open the circuit.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const CircuitBreaker = require('opossum');

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(serviceCall, {
    timeout: 3000,
    errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
    resetTimeout: 30000
});

breaker.fire().then(result => {
    // Handle successful result
}).catch(error => {
    // Handle failure
});
```

### Pattern Name: Database Sharding
**When to Apply**: Use sharding when dealing with large datasets that exceed the capacity of a single database instance.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Split data across multiple database instances based on a sharding key.
2. Implement logic in your application to route queries to the correct shard.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
function getShard(userId) {
    return userId % numberOfShards; // Simple modulo-based sharding
}
```

## Technical Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Assess response times and throughput.
- **Scalability**: Evaluate how easily the system can scale.
- **Maintainability**: Consider how easy it is to maintain and update the system.
- **Security**: Analyze the security measures in place.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Microservices vs. Monolith**: Microservices offer scalability but increase complexity. A monolith simplifies deployment but can hinder scalability.
- **SQL vs. NoSQL**: SQL databases provide strong consistency, while NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use SQL**: Choose SQL when you need complex queries and transactions.
- **When to Use NoSQL**: Opt for NoSQL when dealing with unstructured data or requiring high scalability.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Option          | Cost            | Benefit          |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Microservices    | Higher complexity | Scalability       |
| Monolithic       | Simpler deployment | Easier management |

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Event Sourcing
Store state changes as a sequence of events, allowing for better audit trails and flexibility in rebuilding state.

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
Separate read and write operations to optimize performance and scalability.

### 3. Service Mesh
Implement a service mesh like Istio to manage service-to-service communication, security, and monitoring.

### 4. API Rate Limiting
Use techniques to limit the number of requests a user can make to prevent abuse.

### 5. Blue-Green Deployments
Deploy new versions of services alongside old versions to minimize downtime and enable quick rollbacks.

### 6. Feature Toggles
Use feature flags to enable or disable features without deploying new code.

### 7. Distributed Tracing
Implement tracing tools like Jaeger to monitor and troubleshoot requests across microservices.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Slow API Response** → High database load → Optimize queries and implement caching.
2. **Service Unavailable** → Service crash → Check logs for errors and restart the service.
3. **High Error Rate** → Misconfigured endpoints → Verify endpoint definitions and request formats.
4. **Latency Spikes** → Network issues → Monitor network performance and optimize routing.
5. **Data Inconsistency** → Race conditions → Implement proper locking mechanisms or use eventual consistency.
6. **High Memory Usage** → Memory leaks → Profile memory usage and identify leaks.
