## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
In React Native, performance optimization is crucial due to the hybrid nature of the framework, which combines JavaScript and native code. Understanding the bridge between these two layers is essential for optimizing performance. The JavaScript thread is responsible for executing the application logic, while the native thread handles rendering and interactions. Minimizing the communication between these threads can significantly enhance performance.

Advanced techniques such as **list virtualization** allow developers to render only the items currently visible on the screen, drastically reducing the memory footprint and improving scroll performance. Libraries like `FlatList` and `SectionList` are designed to handle large datasets efficiently by rendering only what is necessary.

Another critical area is **bundle size optimization**. By employing techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking, developers can reduce the initial load time of their applications. Tools like `react-native-bundle-visualizer` can help identify large dependencies and suggest optimizations.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing state management libraries can lead to unnecessary re-renders.
2. Failing to optimize images can result in high memory usage and slow load times.
3. Not utilizing native modules when performance is critical can lead to suboptimal JavaScript execution.
4. Ignoring platform-specific optimizations can lead to inconsistent performance across iOS and Android.
5. Using synchronous APIs can block the JavaScript thread, causing UI freezes.
6. Neglecting to profile the application can result in unidentified performance bottlenecks.
7. Not implementing list virtualization for large datasets can lead to poor scrolling performance.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **React.memo** to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
2. Implement **shouldComponentUpdate** or **React.PureComponent** for class components.
3. Optimize images using libraries like `react-native-fast-image`.
4. Utilize **FlatList** for rendering large lists with virtualization.
5. Profile performance using tools like **Flipper** and **React DevTools**.
6. Minimize the use of inline functions in render methods to avoid re-creation on every render.
7. Use **TypeScript** for type safety and better code maintainability.
8. Leverage **native modules** for performance-critical tasks.
9. Implement **debouncing** for input handlers to reduce the number of renders.
10. Regularly audit dependencies and remove unused libraries to reduce bundle size.

### Performance Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: Aim for a consistent 60 FPS for smooth animations.
- **Bundle Size**: Target a bundle size under 1MB for optimal loading times.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption and keep it below 100MB for mobile devices.
- **Load Time**: Strive for an initial load time of under 3 seconds on average devices.
- **Render Time**: Keep component render times under 16ms to maintain a smooth user experience.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Always use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks before making changes.
2. **Use FlatList for Large Lists**: Always use `FlatList` or `SectionList` for rendering large datasets to leverage virtualization.
3. **Optimize Images**: Always use optimized images to reduce memory usage and loading times.
4. **Avoid Inline Functions**: Do not use inline functions in render methods to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Minimize Bridge Traffic**: Limit the number of calls between JavaScript and native code to enhance performance.
6. **Use Native Modules Wisely**: Implement native modules for performance-critical tasks that cannot be efficiently handled in JavaScript.
7. **Implement Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports to split code and load only what is necessary.
8. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Regularly check memory usage and optimize components that consume excessive memory.
9. **Use TypeScript**: Always use TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
10. **Debounce Input Handlers**: Implement debouncing for input fields to reduce the frequency of state updates.
11. **Avoid Heavy Computations in Render**: Move heavy computations outside of the render method to avoid blocking the UI.
12. **Leverage Caching**: Use caching strategies for data fetching to reduce load times.
13. **Regularly Update Libraries**: Keep libraries updated to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
14. **Test on Real Devices**: Always test performance on real devices rather than simulators to get accurate results.
15. **Use React Native's Performance Monitoring Tools**: Utilize built-in tools for monitoring performance metrics.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid using `setState` in the render method.
  
  ```javascript
  // Anti-pattern
  render() {
      this.setState({ value: newValue }); // This will cause infinite re-renders
      return <Text>{this.state.value}</Text>;
  }
  ```

- **Best Practice**: Use functional components with hooks for state management.

  ```javascript
  // Best practice
  const MyComponent = () => {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
      return <Text>{value}</Text>;
  };
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Flipper Configuration**: Ensure Flipper is set up for React Native by adding the following to `android/app/build.gradle`:

  ```groovy
  debugImplementation 'com.facebook.flipper:flipper:0.93.0'
  debugImplementation 'com.facebook.flipper:flipper-network-plugin:0.93.0'
  ```

- **Metro Bundler**: Configure Metro to enable source maps for better debugging:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
      transformer: {
          getSourceExts: () => ['jsx', 'js', 'ts', 'tsx'],
          getTransformOptions: async () => ({
              transform: {
                  experimentalImportSupport: false,
                  inlineRequires: false,
              },
          }),
      },
  };
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Efficient List Rendering
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when displaying large datasets in a scrollable view.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `FlatList` or `SectionList`.
  2. Set `initialNumToRender` to a reasonable number based on expected user behavior.
  3. Implement `getItemLayout` for fixed-height items to improve performance.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const MyList = ({ data }) => {
      const renderItem = ({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />;
  
      return (
          <FlatList
              data={data}
              renderItem={renderItem}
              keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
              initialNumToRender={10}
              getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
                  { length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index }
              )}
          />
      );
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Image Optimization
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when displaying images in your application.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `react-native-fast-image` for better performance.
  2. Ensure images are properly sized for the device resolution.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import FastImage from 'react-native-fast-image';
  
  const MyImage = ({ uri }) => (
      <FastImage
          style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
          source={{
              uri,
              priority: FastImage.priority.normal,
          }}
          resizeMode={FastImage.resizeMode.cover}
      />
  );
  ```

### Pattern Name: Debouncing Input
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for search inputs or any input that triggers state updates.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Implement a debounce function.
  2. Use `useEffect` to handle input changes.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  
  const DebouncedInput = ({ onChange }) => {
      const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  
      useEffect(() => {
          const handler = setTimeout(() => {
              onChange(inputValue);
          }, 300);
  
          return () => {
              clearTimeout(handler);
          };
      }, [inputValue]);
  
      return (
          <TextInput
              value={inputValue}
              onChangeText={setInputValue}
          />
      );
  };
  ```

## Decision Framework
