## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
When it comes to React Native, optimizing performance is key because it blends JavaScript with native code. Understanding how these two layers interact is crucial. The JavaScript thread runs the application logic, while the native thread manages rendering and user interactions. Reducing the communication between these threads can boost performance significantly.

For instance, using **list virtualization** allows developers to show only the items currently visible on the screen. This drastically cuts down on memory use and enhances scrolling performance. Libraries like `FlatList` and `SectionList` efficiently handle large datasets by rendering only what’s necessary.

Another important area is **bundle size optimization**. By using techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking, developers can decrease the initial load time. Tools such as `react-native-bundle-visualizer` help identify large dependencies and suggest improvements.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing state management libraries can lead to unnecessary re-renders.
2. Not optimizing images can cause high memory use and slow load times.
3. Skipping native modules when performance is critical can lead to sluggish JavaScript execution.
4. Ignoring platform-specific tweaks can create inconsistent performance across iOS and Android.
5. Using synchronous APIs can block the JavaScript thread and cause UI freezes.
6. Failing to profile the application may leave performance bottlenecks undetected.
7. Not implementing list virtualization for large datasets can lead to sluggish scrolling.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Utilize **React.memo** to stop unnecessary re-renders of components.
2. Use **shouldComponentUpdate** or **React.PureComponent** for class components.
3. Optimize images with libraries like `react-native-fast-image`.
4. Use **FlatList** for rendering large lists with virtualization.
5. Profile performance with tools like **Flipper** and **React DevTools**.
6. Reduce the use of inline functions in render methods to avoid re-creating them on every render.
7. Choose **TypeScript** for type safety and better code maintainability.
8. Leverage **native modules** for tasks that require high performance.
9. Implement **debouncing** for input handlers to cut back on renders.
10. Regularly audit dependencies and remove any unused libraries to keep bundle size in check.

### Performance Metrics
- **Frame Rate**: Aim for a steady 60 FPS for smooth animations.
- **Bundle Size**: Target a bundle size under 1MB for quick loading.
- **Memory Usage**: Keep memory use below 100MB for mobile devices.
- **Load Time**: Strive for an initial load time of under 3 seconds on average devices.
- **Render Time**: Keep component render times under 16ms to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Profile Before Optimizing**: Always use profiling tools to find bottlenecks before making changes.
2. **Use FlatList for Large Lists**: Always use `FlatList` or `SectionList` for large datasets to take advantage of virtualization.
3. **Optimize Images**: Use optimized images to lower memory use and loading times.
4. **Avoid Inline Functions**: Don’t use inline functions in render methods to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Minimize Bridge Traffic**: Limit calls between JavaScript and native code to boost performance.
6. **Use Native Modules Wisely**: Implement native modules for tasks that require high performance and can’t be efficiently handled in JavaScript.
7. **Implement Code Splitting**: Use dynamic imports to load only necessary code.
8. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Regularly check memory use and optimize components that consume too much memory.
9. **Use TypeScript**: Always use TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability.
10. **Debounce Input Handlers**: Implement debouncing for input fields to reduce state update frequency.
11. **Avoid Heavy Computations in Render**: Move heavy computations outside of the render method to keep the UI responsive.
12. **Leverage Caching**: Use caching strategies for data fetching to speed up load times.
13. **Regularly Update Libraries**: Keep libraries up to date to benefit from performance improvements and bug fixes.
14. **Test on Real Devices**: Always test performance on real devices instead of simulators for accurate results.
15. **Use React Native's Performance Monitoring Tools**: Take advantage of built-in tools for tracking performance metrics.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid using `setState` in the render method.

  ```javascript
  // Anti-pattern
  render() {
      this.setState({ value: newValue }); // This will cause infinite re-renders
      return <Text>{this.state.value}</Text>;
  }
  ```

- **Best Practice**: Use functional components with hooks for state management.

  ```javascript
  // Best practice
  const MyComponent = () => {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);
      return <Text>{value}</Text>;
  };
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Flipper Configuration**: Set up Flipper for React Native by adding this to `android/app/build.gradle`:

  ```groovy
  debugImplementation 'com.facebook.flipper:flipper:0.93.0'
  debugImplementation 'com.facebook.flipper:flipper-network-plugin:0.93.0'
  ```

- **Metro Bundler**: Configure Metro to enable source maps for easier debugging:

  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
      transformer: {
          getSourceExts: () => ['jsx', 'js', 'ts', 'tsx'],
          getTransformOptions: async () => ({
              transform: {
                  experimentalImportSupport: false,
                  inlineRequires: false,
              },
          }),
      },
  };
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Efficient List Rendering
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when showing large datasets in a scrollable view.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `FlatList` or `SectionList`.
  2. Set `initialNumToRender` to a reasonable number based on expected user behavior.
  3. Implement `getItemLayout` for fixed-height items to boost performance.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const MyList = ({ data }) => {
      const renderItem = ({ item }) => <ItemComponent item={item} />;
  
      return (
          <FlatList
              data={data}
              renderItem={renderItem}
              keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
              initialNumToRender={10}
              getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
                  { length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index }
              )}
          />
      );
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Image Optimization
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when displaying images in your application.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `react-native-fast-image` for better performance.
  2. Ensure images are properly sized for the device resolution.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import FastImage from 'react-native-fast-image';
  
  const MyImage = ({ uri }) => (
      <FastImage
          style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}
          source={{
              uri,
              priority: FastImage.priority.normal,
          }}
          resizeMode={FastImage.resizeMode.cover}
      />
  );
  ```

### Pattern Name: Debouncing Input
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for search inputs or any input that triggers state updates.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Implement a debounce function.
  2. Use `useEffect` to manage input changes.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
  
  const DebouncedInput = ({ onChange }) => {
      const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
  
      useEffect(() => {
          const handler = setTimeout(() => {
              onChange(inputValue);
          }, 300);
  
          return () => {
              clearTimeout(handler);
          };
      }, [inputValue]);
  
      return (
          <TextInput
              value={inputValue}
              onChangeText={setInputValue}
          />
      );
  };
  ```
