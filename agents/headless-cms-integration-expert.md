## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles

1. **Design for Scalability**: Create a content model that can handle increased traffic.
   - *Why*: Scalability keeps performance steady during traffic spikes.

2. **Use Version Control for Content Models**: Implement versioning for content structure changes.
   - *Why*: This maintains compatibility and prevents breaking changes.

3. **Implement API Rate Limiting**: Set limits on API calls to prevent overload.
   - *Why*: This protects your service and ensures fair usage.

4. **Utilize Environment Variables for Configuration**: Store sensitive information in environment variables rather than hardcoding it.
   - *Why*: This enhances security by hiding sensitive data.

5. **Regularly Audit API Security**: Conduct audits to identify vulnerabilities in your API.
   - *Why*: This protects against unauthorized access.

6. **Optimize Images and Assets**: Use responsive images and lazy loading to speed up load times.
   - *Why*: This improves the user experience.

7. **Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Use CDNs to cache and deliver content closer to users.
   - *Why*: This reduces latency and speeds up delivery.

8. **Test Webhook Integrations**: Regularly check webhook functionality to ensure timely updates.
   - *Why*: This prevents stale content.

9. **Monitor API Usage**: Use analytics to track API usage and optimize as needed.
   - *Why*: This helps identify bottlenecks.

10. **Document Your APIs**: Keep thorough API documentation for developers.
    - *Why*: This makes integration easier and speeds up onboarding.

### Code Standards

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and functions, and snake_case for database fields.
  
- **Error Handling**: Always include error handling in API responses.
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/content', (req, res) => {
      try {
          const content = getContent();
          res.json(content);
      } catch (error) {
          res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' });
      }
  });
  ```

- **Use HTTP Status Codes Appropriately**: Return the correct status codes for different outcomes (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
  
- **Avoid Deeply Nested Structures**: Keep API responses simple to enhance readability and performance.
  
- **Rate Limit Responses**: Include headers to inform clients of their remaining API call limits.

### Tool Configuration

- **Strapi Configuration Example**:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
      apiToken: env('API_TOKEN'),
      host: env('HOST', '0.0.0.0'),
      port: env.int('PORT', 1337),
      admin: {
          auth: {
              secret: env('ADMIN_JWT_SECRET', 'yourSecretKey'),
          },
      },
  });
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Content Model Versioning

- **When to Apply**: Use this when making significant changes to content structure that might affect existing content.
  
- **Implementation Details**: Establish a versioning system in your content models to track changes over time. Each model can include a version field that increments with each update.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "id": "1",
      "title": "Sample Article",
      "content": "This is a sample article.",
      "version": 2
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Webhook Event Handling

- **When to Apply**: Use this when real-time updates are needed across multiple platforms.
  
- **Implementation Details**: Set up webhook endpoints that listen for specific events (like content being published) and trigger updates in other systems.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.post('/webhook/content-published', (req, res) => {
      const { contentId } = req.body;
      updateExternalSystem(contentId);
      res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: API Rate Limiting

- **When to Apply**: Implement this to prevent abuse and ensure fair API usage.
  
- **Implementation Details**: Use middleware to track requests from each client and limit them based on set thresholds.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
  const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  });
  app.use(limiter);
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Performance**: Measure how quickly APIs respond and how fast content is delivered.
  
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the system handles increased loads.
  
- **Security**: Review the security measures for API access.
  
- **Maintainability**: Consider how easy it is to update and manage the system.
