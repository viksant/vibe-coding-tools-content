## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Implementing dark mode requires a solid understanding of how color schemes influence users. Dark themes can ease eye strain in low-light settings and help save battery life on OLED screens. Using CSS custom properties allows for flexible theming, where colors can shift easily without overhauling the entire CSS. Libraries like `next-themes` and `use-dark-mode` help detect user preferences and system settings, making automatic theme changes possible.

Accessibility remains a top priority when working with dark mode. It’s vital to ensure that text is legible against dark backgrounds, following WCAG guidelines for color contrast. This demands careful color selection and thorough testing on different devices and in various lighting conditions.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Accessibility**: Skipping color contrast checks can leave users with visual impairments frustrated.
2. **Inconsistent Theme Application**: If dark mode isn’t applied uniformly across components, users can feel disjointed.
3. **Neglecting System Preferences**: Overriding user settings can be annoying for those who prefer a specific theme.
4. **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)**: Without the right loading strategy, users might experience jarring transitions.
5. **Hardcoding Colors**: Relying on fixed colors instead of CSS custom properties restricts flexibility and scalability.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use CSS custom properties to define color schemes for easy switching.
2. Provide a theme toggle that honors user preferences and system settings.
3. Ensure all text meets a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against backgrounds.
4. Test themes across different devices and lighting for consistency.
5. Implement smooth transitions when changing themes.
6. Store user theme preferences in local storage for continuity.
7. Use tools like `axe` or `Lighthouse` to audit accessibility compliance.
8. Refresh color palettes based on user feedback and accessibility standards.
9. Document theme styles and guidelines for future consistency.
10. Leverage frameworks like Tailwind CSS for utility-first theming.

### Performance Metrics
- **Color Contrast Ratio**: Aim for at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
- **User Preference Respect Rate**: Track how well the system adheres to user preferences for dark mode.
- **Theme Transition Time**: Keep transition times under 300ms for a smooth experience.
- **Accessibility Audit Scores**: Maintain a score of 90 or higher in accessibility audits.

:root {
  --background-color: #121212; /* Dark background */
  --text-color: #ffffff; /* Light text */
  --primary-color: #bb86fc; /* Primary accent color */
}
```

- **Dark Mode Toggle Implementation**:
```javascript
const toggleTheme = () => {
  const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
  const newTheme = currentTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
  document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme);
  localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
};
```

### Tool Configuration
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        dark: '#121212',
        light: '#ffffff',
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Theme Toggle with Persistence
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when users want to switch themes manually while keeping their preference across sessions.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a toggle button for theme switching.
  2. Store the selected theme in local storage.
  3. Apply the theme on page load based on stored preference.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const ThemeToggle = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light');

  useEffect(() => {
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
  }, [theme]);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const newTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    setTheme(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
  };

  return <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>;
};
```

### Pattern Name: Automatic System Preference Detection
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern to automatically switch themes based on user system settings.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use the `matchMedia` API to detect system theme preference.
  2. Apply the detected theme on initial load.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)');
  const handleChange = () => {
    const newTheme = mediaQuery.matches ? 'dark' : 'light';
    setTheme(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
  };

  mediaQuery.addEventListener('change', handleChange);
  handleChange(); // Set initial theme

  return () => mediaQuery.removeEventListener('change', handleChange);
}, []);
```

### Pattern Name: Accessibility Compliance Checker
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern during design to ensure color combinations meet accessibility standards.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a utility function to check color contrast.
  2. Integrate this function into the design workflow.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const getContrastYIQ = (hexcolor) => {
  const r = parseInt(hexcolor.slice(1, 3), 16);
  const g = parseInt(hexcolor.slice(3, 5), 16);
  const b = parseInt(hexcolor.slice(5, 7), 16);
  const yiq = (r * 299 + g * 587 + b * 114) / 1000;
  return yiq >= 128 ? 'black' : 'white';
};
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **User Preference Compliance**: How well does the theme respect user settings?
- **Accessibility**: Are all color combinations compliant with WCAG standards?
