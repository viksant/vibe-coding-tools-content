## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern for tasks that require multi-step reasoning or complex decision-making.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Start with a clear question or task.
2. Break down the reasoning process into steps.
3. Encourage the model to think through each step logically.

**Code Example**:
```
You are a financial analyst. Let's think step by step about how to evaluate the profitability of a new product. First, consider the costs involved. Next, analyze the expected revenue. Finally, calculate the profit margin.
```

### Pattern Name: Constitutional AI Prompt
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern for tasks that require ethical considerations and self-correction.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Define the ethical guidelines for the task.
2. Encourage the model to critique its own outputs based on these guidelines.

**Code Example**:
```
You are an AI assistant. Please generate a response to the following question while ensuring it aligns with ethical standards: "What are the potential risks of AI in society?" Critique your response to ensure it does not promote harmful ideas.
```

### Pattern Name: Multi-Agent Collaboration
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when coordinating tasks among multiple AI agents.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Define roles for each agent involved.
2. Establish communication protocols for information sharing.

**Code Example**:
```
Agent A, you are responsible for gathering data on customer preferences. Agent B, you will analyze this data to generate insights. Please communicate your findings to each other to create a comprehensive report.
```
