## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Mocking is a critical technique in unit testing that allows developers to isolate the code under test by replacing dependencies with controlled substitutes. **Stubs** provide predefined responses to calls made during the test, while **mocks** are more sophisticated, allowing for verification of interactions. Understanding the differences and appropriate use cases for each is essential for effective test design. 

Partial mocking is another advanced technique where only certain methods of a class are mocked, while others retain their original behavior. This is particularly useful when you want to test a class that has both complex logic and external dependencies. Dependency injection plays a pivotal role in facilitating testability, as it allows for the easy substitution of real dependencies with mocks or stubs.

Mock verification patterns are essential to ensure that the expected interactions with mocks occur as intended. This includes checking that methods were called the expected number of times and with the correct parameters. However, over-mocking can lead to brittle tests that are difficult to maintain. Striking a balance between isolation and realism is key to effective testing.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Over-Mocking**: Creating mocks for every dependency can lead to tests that are too rigid and not reflective of real-world scenarios.
- **Ignoring Mock Verification**: Failing to verify that mocks were called as expected can result in tests that pass without actually validating behavior.
- **Not Using Dependency Injection**: Hardcoding dependencies makes it difficult to replace them with mocks, leading to less testable code.
- **Neglecting Edge Cases**: Focusing only on happy paths can leave critical scenarios untested.
- **Inconsistent Mocking Frameworks**: Mixing different mocking libraries can lead to confusion and inconsistent test behavior.
- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Using unclear names for mocks can make tests harder to understand.
- **Not Cleaning Up Mocks**: Failing to reset or clear mocks between tests can lead to false positives or negatives.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use **dependency injection** to facilitate easier mocking of dependencies.
- Apply **stubs** for simple method responses and **mocks** for verifying interactions.
- Implement **mock verification** to ensure methods are called as expected.
- Limit the use of mocks to external dependencies, avoiding mocks for internal logic.
- Use **test doubles** judiciously to maintain a balance between isolation and realism.
- Regularly review and refactor tests to avoid over-mocking and ensure clarity.
- Utilize **mocking frameworks** consistently across the codebase to maintain uniformity.
- Document mocking strategies and decisions to enhance team understanding.
- Leverage **CI/CD pipelines** to run tests automatically and catch issues early.
- Continuously monitor test performance and coverage metrics to identify areas for improvement.

### Performance Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% coverage, focusing on critical paths.
- **Mock Verification Rate**: Ensure that 90% of mocks are verified in tests.
- **Test Execution Time**: Keep individual test execution time under 200ms.
- **Flakiness Rate**: Maintain a flakiness rate below 5% to ensure reliability.
- **Code Complexity**: Monitor cyclomatic complexity to ensure tests remain understandable.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use Dependency Injection**: Always inject dependencies to facilitate easier mocking. This enhances testability and reduces coupling.
2. **Limit Mock Scope**: Only mock external dependencies; avoid mocking internal logic to maintain test fidelity.
3. **Verify Mock Interactions**: Always verify that mocks are called as expected to ensure correct behavior.
4. **Use Stubs for Simple Returns**: Employ stubs for methods that return fixed values without side effects.
5. **Avoid Over-Mocking**: Limit the number of mocks to prevent brittle tests; focus on what is necessary.
6. **Reset Mocks Between Tests**: Always reset or clear mocks to avoid state leakage between tests.
7. **Document Mock Usage**: Clearly document the purpose and behavior of mocks to improve team understanding.
8. **Use Consistent Naming**: Adopt clear and consistent naming conventions for mocks to enhance readability.
9. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure tests cover edge cases to validate robustness.
10. **Leverage Built-in Mocking Features**: Utilize features provided by mocking frameworks to simplify test setup.
11. **Monitor Test Performance**: Regularly analyze test execution times and optimize as necessary.
12. **Avoid Mocking Framework Mixing**: Stick to one mocking library to maintain consistency and reduce confusion.
13. **Use Partial Mocks Judiciously**: Only use partial mocks when necessary to test specific behaviors without losing original functionality.
14. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Ensure tests run automatically in CI/CD pipelines for early detection of issues.
15. **Refactor Regularly**: Continuously review and refactor tests to maintain clarity and effectiveness.

### Code Standards
- **Example of a Stub**:
```javascript
const myFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');
// Usage
expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
```
- **Example of a Mock Verification**:
```javascript
const myMock = jest.fn();
myMock('test');
expect(myMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test');
```
- **Anti-Pattern Example**:
```javascript
// Over-mocking example
const myService = new MyService();
const myMock = jest.spyOn(myService, 'getData').mockImplementation(() => 'mocked data');
// This could lead to brittle tests if getData is not the focus of the test.
```

### Tool Configuration
- **Jest Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "preset": "ts-jest",
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageDirectory": "coverage",
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": 80
    }
  }
}
```
- **Sinon Configuration Example**:
```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const myStub = sinon.stub().returns('mocked value');
// Usage
expect(myStub()).to.equal('mocked value');
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Stub for API Calls
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when testing components that rely on external API calls.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a stub for the API call.
  2. Inject the stub into the component.
  3. Verify that the component behaves correctly with the stubbed response.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const fetchData = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' });
const component = new MyComponent(fetchData);
await component.loadData();
expect(component.data).toEqual('mocked data');
```

### Pattern Name: Mocking a Database Call
- **When to Apply**: When testing service layers that interact with a database.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use a mock to simulate database interactions.
  2. Verify that the service calls the database as expected.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const dbMock = jest.fn();
const service = new UserService(dbMock);
service.getUser(1);
expect(dbMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
```

### Pattern Name: Partial Mocking
- **When to Apply**: When you need to mock only specific methods of a class while keeping the rest intact.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use a mocking framework to create a partial mock.
  2. Call the method that uses the mocked method and verify behavior.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  methodA() { return 'A'; }
  methodB() { return this.methodA(); }
}

const partialMock = jest.spyOn(MyClass.prototype, 'methodA').mockReturnValue('mocked A');
const instance = new MyClass();
expect(instance.methodB()).toEqual('mocked A');
partialMock.mockRestore();
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Test Coverage**: Assess the percentage of code covered by tests.
- **Mock Verification**: Check if mocks are called as expected.
- **Execution Speed**: Evaluate the time taken for tests to run.
- **Flakiness**: Monitor the stability of tests across runs.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Isolation vs. Realism**: More mocks provide isolation but can lead to tests that do not reflect real-world behavior.
- **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: Complex mocking setups can lead to maintenance challenges; simpler setups are easier to manage but may miss edge cases.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Mocks vs. Stubs**:
  - If you need to verify interactions, choose mocks.
  - If you only need to provide a return value, choose stubs.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach           | Benefits                               | Costs                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Full Mocks         | High isolation, precise verification    | Risk of over-mocking, brittle tests    |
| Stubs              | Simplicity, easier to maintain         | Less control over interactions         |
| Partial Mocks      | Balance between isolation and realism   | More complex setup                     |

## Advanced Techniques
1. **Dynamic Mocking**: Create mocks that can change behavior based on input parameters to simulate various scenarios.
2. **Mocking Asynchronous Code**: Use tools like Jest's `mockResolvedValue` for promises to handle async behavior effectively.
3. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Mocks**: Implement mocks in a BDD approach to define expected behavior before writing tests.
4. **Integration of Mocks with CI/CD**: Automate the running of tests with mocks in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
5. **Using Mocking Libraries for Performance Testing**: Leverage mocking libraries to simulate load and performance testing scenarios without hitting real services.
6. **Combining Mocks with Spies**: Use spies to track calls to real methods while still allowing for controlled behavior through mocks.
7. **Mocking for Security Testing**: Create mocks that simulate security vulnerabilities to test the robustness of your application against attacks.
