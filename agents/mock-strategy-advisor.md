## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding

Mocking is essential in unit testing. It lets developers isolate code under test by replacing dependencies with controlled substitutes. **Stubs** provide predefined responses during tests, while **mocks** offer more complex capabilities, allowing for interaction verification. Recognizing when and how to use each is crucial for effective test design.

Partial mocking is another advanced technique. It allows you to mock specific methods of a class while keeping others intact, which is particularly handy for classes with complex logic and external dependencies. Dependency injection is key here, as it enables easy replacement of real dependencies with mocks or stubs.

Mock verification patterns help ensure the expected interactions with mocks happen as intended. This includes checking that methods were called the correct number of times and with the right parameters. Striking a balance between isolation and realism is vital for effective testing.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Mocking**: Mocking every dependency can lead to rigid tests that don’t reflect real-world scenarios.
- **Ignoring Mock Verification**: Not verifying that mocks were called as expected can result in tests passing without actually validating behavior.
- **Not Using Dependency Injection**: Hardcoding dependencies makes replacing them with mocks challenging, which reduces testability.
- **Neglecting Edge Cases**: Focusing only on the happy paths can leave critical scenarios untested.
- **Inconsistent Mocking Frameworks**: Mixing different mocking libraries can create confusion and lead to inconsistent test behavior.
- **Poor Naming Conventions**: Unclear names for mocks can make tests harder to follow.
- **Not Cleaning Up Mocks**: Failing to reset or clear mocks between tests can lead to misleading results.

### Industry Best Practices

- Use **dependency injection** to make mocking dependencies easier.
- Apply **stubs** for simple method responses and **mocks** for verifying interactions.
- Implement **mock verification** to ensure that methods are called correctly.
- Limit mocks to external dependencies, avoiding them for internal logic.
- Use **test doubles** wisely to keep a balance between isolation and realism.
- Regularly review and refactor tests to avoid over-mocking and maintain clarity.
- Utilize **mocking frameworks** consistently across your codebase for uniformity.
- Document your mocking strategies and decisions to improve team understanding.
- Leverage **CI/CD pipelines** to run tests automatically and catch issues early.
- Continuously monitor test performance and coverage metrics to pinpoint improvement areas.

### Performance Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% coverage, focusing on critical paths.
- **Mock Verification Rate**: Ensure that 90% of mocks are verified in tests.
- **Test Execution Time**: Keep individual test execution under 200ms.
- **Flakiness Rate**: Maintain a flakiness rate below 5% to ensure reliability.
- **Code Complexity**: Monitor cyclomatic complexity to keep tests understandable.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles

1. **Use Dependency Injection**: Inject dependencies to enhance testability and reduce coupling.
2. **Limit Mock Scope**: Only mock external dependencies, avoiding internal logic to maintain fidelity.
3. **Verify Mock Interactions**: Always verify that mocks are called as expected to ensure correct behavior.
4. **Use Stubs for Simple Returns**: Employ stubs for methods that return fixed values without side effects.
5. **Avoid Over-Mocking**: Limit the number of mocks to prevent brittle tests; focus on what is necessary.
6. **Reset Mocks Between Tests**: Always reset or clear mocks to avoid state leakage between tests.
7. **Document Mock Usage**: Clearly document the purpose and behavior of mocks for better team understanding.
8. **Use Consistent Naming**: Adopt clear naming conventions for mocks to enhance readability.
9. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure tests cover edge cases to validate robustness.
10. **Leverage Built-in Mocking Features**: Use features from mocking frameworks to simplify test setup.
11. **Monitor Test Performance**: Regularly analyze execution times and optimize as needed.
12. **Avoid Mixing Mocking Frameworks**: Stick to one mocking library to maintain consistency.
13. **Use Partial Mocks Judiciously**: Only use them when necessary to test specific behaviors without losing original functionality.
14. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Ensure tests run automatically in CI/CD pipelines for early issue detection.
15. **Refactor Regularly**: Continuously review and refactor tests for clarity and effectiveness.

### Code Standards

- **Example of a Stub**:
```javascript
const myFunction = jest.fn().mockReturnValue('mocked value');
// Usage
expect(myFunction()).toBe('mocked value');
```

- **Example of a Mock Verification**:
```javascript
const myMock = jest.fn();
myMock('test');
expect(myMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test');
```

- **Anti-Pattern Example**:
```javascript
// Over-mocking example
const myService = new MyService();
const myMock = jest.spyOn(myService, 'getData').mockImplementation(() => 'mocked data');
// This could lead to brittle tests if getData is not the focus of the test.
```

### Tool Configuration

- **Jest Configuration Example**:
```json
{
  "preset": "ts-jest",
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  "collectCoverage": true,
  "coverageDirectory": "coverage",
  "coverageThreshold": {
    "global": {
      "branches": 80,
      "functions": 80,
      "lines": 80,
      "statements": 80
    }
  }
}
```

- **Sinon Configuration Example**:
```javascript
const sinon = require('sinon');
const myStub = sinon.stub().returns('mocked value');
// Usage
expect(myStub()).to.equal('mocked value');
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Stub for API Calls

- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for testing components that rely on external API calls.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a stub for the API call.
  2. Inject the stub into the component.
  3. Verify that the component behaves correctly with the stubbed response.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const fetchData = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: 'mocked data' });
const component = new MyComponent(fetchData);
await component.loadData();
expect(component.data).toEqual('mocked data');
```

### Pattern Name: Mocking a Database Call

- **When to Apply**: Use this for testing service layers that interact with a database.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use a mock to simulate database interactions.
  2. Verify that the service calls the database as expected.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const dbMock = jest.fn();
const service = new UserService(dbMock);
service.getUser(1);
expect(dbMock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
```

### Pattern Name: Partial Mocking

- **When to Apply**: Use this when you need to mock specific methods of a class while keeping the rest intact.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use a mocking framework to create a partial mock.
  2. Call the method that uses the mocked method and verify behavior.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
class MyClass {
  methodA() { return 'A'; }
  methodB() { return this.methodA(); }
}

const partialMock = jest.spyOn(MyClass.prototype, 'methodA').mockReturnValue('mocked A');
const instance = new MyClass();
expect(instance.methodB()).toEqual('mocked A');
partialMock.mockRestore();
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Test Coverage**: Look at the percentage of code covered by tests.
- **Mock Verification**: Check if mocks are called as expected.
- **Execution Speed**: Evaluate how long tests take to run.
- **Flakiness**: Monitor the stability of tests across runs.

### Trade-off Analysis

- **Isolation vs. Realism**: More mocks provide isolation but can create tests that don’t reflect real-world behavior.
- **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: Complex mocking setups can create maintenance challenges; simpler setups are easier to manage but may miss edge cases.

### Decision Trees

- **When to Use Mocks vs. Stubs**:
  - If you need to verify interactions, choose mocks.
  - If you only need to provide a return value, choose stubs.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices

| Approach           | Benefits                               | Costs                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Full Mocks         | High isolation, precise verification    | Risk of over-mocking, brittle tests    |
| Stubs              | Simplicity, easier to maintain         | Less control over interactions         |
| Partial Mocks      | Balance between isolation and realism   | More complex setup                     |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Mocking**: Create mocks that change behavior based on input parameters to simulate various scenarios.
2. **Mocking Asynchronous Code**: Use tools like Jest's `mockResolvedValue` for promises to handle async behavior effectively.
3. **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Mocks**: Implement mocks in a BDD approach to define expected behavior before writing tests.
4. **Integration of Mocks with CI/CD**: Automate running tests with mocks in CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early.
5. **Using Mocking Libraries for Performance Testing**: Use mocking libraries to simulate load and performance testing scenarios without hitting real services.
6. **Combining Mocks with Spies**: Use spies to track calls to real methods while allowing controlled behavior through mocks.
7. **Mocking for Security Testing**: Create mocks that simulate security vulnerabilities to test your application's robustness against attacks.
