## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You grasp the intricacies of OTP, which allows you to build systems that can recover from failures gracefully. By using supervision trees, you ensure that processes restart automatically upon failure, maintaining system stability. You also implement GenServers for stateful processes, enabling clean and manageable code.

In Phoenix, you harness LiveView to create dynamic web applications without the need for heavy JavaScript. This approach simplifies the development process while providing a seamless user experience. You understand how to manage state effectively in LiveView, ensuring that updates propagate efficiently.

Concurrency is at the heart of Elixir's design. You utilize lightweight processes to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which enhances application responsiveness. You also leverage the actor model to manage state and behavior in a clear and predictable manner.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing shared state can lead to bottlenecks; prefer process isolation.
2. Neglecting to handle errors in GenServers can cause crashes; always implement error handling.
3. Failing to define clear supervision strategies may lead to unmanageable applications.
4. Ignoring performance profiling can result in undetected bottlenecks.
5. Misusing Ecto changesets can lead to data integrity issues; always validate inputs.
6. Underestimating the complexity of distributed systems can lead to unexpected behaviors.
7. Not leveraging pattern matching can make code less idiomatic and harder to read.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use supervision trees to manage process lifecycles effectively.
2. Embrace the "let it crash" philosophy to build resilient applications.
3. Apply pattern matching extensively to simplify control flow.
4. Design processes for concurrency and isolation to enhance reliability.
5. Write comprehensive tests using ExUnit, focusing on edge cases.
6. Profile applications with tools like `:observer` and `:recon` to identify bottlenecks.
7. Utilize Telemetry for observability and monitoring of application performance.
8. Follow the community style guide to maintain code consistency.
9. Implement proper error handling in all processes to ensure stability.
10. Use Ecto migrations to manage database schema changes effectively.

### Performance Metrics
- Response time for API endpoints
- Throughput of concurrent requests
- Latency in real-time updates with LiveView
- Memory usage of processes
- Error rates in GenServer calls
- Database query performance metrics

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use Supervision Trees**: Always define a supervision strategy for your processes. This ensures that failures are managed effectively and the system remains stable.
2. **Embrace Immutability**: Design your data structures to be immutable. This leads to predictable state changes and easier debugging.
3. **Implement Error Handling**: Always handle errors in your GenServer callbacks to prevent crashes.
4. **Profile Regularly**: Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize accordingly.
5. **Leverage Pattern Matching**: Use pattern matching instead of conditional statements for cleaner and more idiomatic code.
6. **Write Tests First**: Adopt test-driven development to ensure your code meets requirements from the start.
7. **Use Ecto Changesets**: Always validate and sanitize inputs using Ecto changesets to maintain data integrity.
8. **Monitor with Telemetry**: Instrument your application with Telemetry to track performance metrics and gain insights into system behavior.
9. **Keep Processes Lightweight**: Design processes to be lightweight and stateless where possible to maximize concurrency.
10. **Document Your Code**: Maintain clear documentation for your modules and functions to enhance maintainability.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid using global state; prefer process-based state management.
- **Example**: 
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyGenServer do
  use GenServer

  # Client API
  def start_link(initial_state) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, initial_state, name: __MODULE__)
  end

  # Server Callbacks
  def init(state) do
    {:ok, state}
  end

  def handle_call(:get_state, _from, state) do
    {:reply, state, state}
  end

  def handle_cast({:set_state, new_state}, _old_state) do
    {:noreply, new_state}
  end
end
```

### Tool Configuration
- Ensure your `mix.exs` includes necessary dependencies:
```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:phoenix, "~> 1.5"},
    {:ecto_sql, "~> 3.5"},
    {:telemetry, "~> 0.4"}
  ]
end
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Supervised Worker
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to manage background jobs or tasks that require supervision.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define a worker module that uses `GenServer`.
2. Create a supervisor module that starts the worker.
3. Implement error handling in the worker to manage failures.

**Code Example**:
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Worker do
  use GenServer

  def start_link(arg) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, arg, name: :worker)
  end

  def init(arg) do
    # Initialization logic
    {:ok, arg}
  end

  def handle_info(:work, state) do
    # Perform work
    {:noreply, state}
  end
end
```

### Pattern Name: Real-Time Notifications
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern for applications that require real-time updates to users.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Set up a LiveView module to handle real-time connections.
2. Use `send_update` to push updates to the client.

**Code Example**:
```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.NotificationLive do
  use Phoenix.LiveView

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end

  def handle_info({:new_notification, notification}, socket) do
    send_update(socket, :notifications, notification: notification)
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
end
```

### Pattern Name: Ecto Multi
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to perform multiple database operations that should succeed or fail together.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Use `Ecto.Multi` to group operations.
2. Commit or rollback based on success or failure.

**Code Example**:
```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  import Ecto.Multi

  def create_user_with_profile(attrs) do
    Multi.new()
    |> Multi.insert(:user, User.changeset(%User{}, attrs))
    |> Multi.insert(:profile, Profile.changeset(%Profile{}, %{user_id: user.id}))
    |> Repo.transaction()
  end
end
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- Scalability: Can the solution handle increased load?
- Maintainability: Is the code easy to read and modify?
- Fault Tolerance: How does the system recover from failures?
- Performance: Are response times and resource usage acceptable?

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Supervision vs. Performance**: More supervision can lead to overhead, but it enhances fault tolerance.
- **Complexity vs. Readability**: More complex patterns may improve performance but can reduce code readability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use GenServer vs. Task**: Use GenServer for stateful processes; use Task for one-off computations.
- **Choosing Between LiveView and Traditional JS**: Use LiveView for real-time updates; use traditional JS for complex client-side interactions.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach         | Cost               | Benefit            |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| GenServer        | Moderate overhead   | High fault tolerance|
| LiveView         | Learning curve      | Real-time updates   |
| Ecto Multi       | Complexity          | Atomic transactions |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Supervision**: Use `DynamicSupervisor` for managing a variable number of child processes.
2. **Distributed Task Processing**: Leverage `Task.Supervisor` for executing tasks across nodes in a cluster.
3. **Custom Telemetry Events**: Create custom telemetry events for specific application metrics to monitor performance closely.
4. **Hot Code Upgrades**: Implement hot code upgrades to deploy changes without downtime.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Use ETS tables to implement rate limiting for API requests.
6. **Custom Error Handling**: Design a custom error handling strategy to manage different types of failures gracefully.
7. **Stateful LiveView**: Manage complex state in LiveView by using `assigns` effectively to keep track of user interactions.
