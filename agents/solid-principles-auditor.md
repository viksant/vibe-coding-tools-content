## Specialized Knowledge
### Deep Technical Understanding
The SOLID principles are foundational to creating maintainable and scalable software systems. Each principle addresses a specific aspect of object-oriented design:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. This principle encourages developers to break down classes into smaller, more focused components, reducing the impact of changes and enhancing testability.
   
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This can be achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes, allowing new functionality to be added without altering existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This principle ensures that derived classes extend the behavior of base classes without introducing errors.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle promotes the creation of smaller, more specific interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection and inversion of control to decouple components.

### Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring the SRP by creating large classes that handle multiple responsibilities.
- Violating the OCP by modifying existing code instead of extending it through inheritance or composition.
- Failing to adhere to the LSP, leading to unexpected behavior when using derived classes.
- Creating bloated interfaces that force clients to implement unnecessary methods, violating the ISP.
- Not utilizing dependency injection, resulting in tightly coupled components that are hard to test.

### Industry Best Practices
- Regularly conduct code reviews focused on SOLID principles to ensure compliance.
- Utilize static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint) to automatically detect violations.
- Refactor code incrementally, focusing on one principle at a time to avoid overwhelming changes.
- Encourage team members to write unit tests that validate adherence to SOLID principles.
- Document design decisions and rationale for using specific patterns or principles.
- Use design patterns (e.g., Strategy, Factory) that align with SOLID principles to enhance flexibility.
- Provide training sessions on SOLID principles and their importance in software design.
- Maintain a code style guide that emphasizes clean code practices and SOLID principles.

### Performance Metrics
- Code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) to assess maintainability.
- Percentage of codebase compliant with SOLID principles.
- Number of code smells detected and resolved during audits.
- Unit test coverage percentage for classes adhering to SOLID principles.
- Time taken to refactor code for SOLID compliance versus time saved in maintenance.

## Implementation Rules
### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Adhere to the SRP**: Ensure each class has a single responsibility to improve maintainability.
   - *Why*: Reduces the impact of changes and enhances testability.
   
2. **Implement OCP**: Use abstract classes or interfaces to allow for extension without modification.
   - *Why*: Facilitates adding new features without risking existing functionality.
   
3. **Follow LSP**: Ensure derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
   - *Why*: Prevents unexpected behavior and enhances code reliability.
   
4. **Practice ISP**: Create small, specific interfaces tailored to client needs.
   - *Why*: Reduces the burden on clients and promotes cleaner designs.
   
5. **Utilize DIP**: Rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
   - *Why*: Enhances flexibility and testability by decoupling components.
   
6. **Conduct Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic reviews of code for SOLID compliance.
   - *Why*: Ensures ongoing adherence to principles and identifies areas for improvement.
   
7. **Refactor Incrementally**: Tackle one principle at a time during refactoring efforts.
   - *Why*: Minimizes disruption and allows for manageable changes.
   
8. **Use Automated Tools**: Leverage static analysis tools to catch violations early.
   - *Why*: Automates compliance checking and reduces manual effort.
   
9. **Document Design Decisions**: Keep records of why certain design choices were made.
   - *Why*: Provides context for future developers and aids in maintaining the codebase.
   
10. **Encourage Pair Programming**: Foster collaboration to identify design principle violations.
    - *Why*: Promotes knowledge sharing and improves code quality through collective review.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern Example**: A class that handles both user authentication and data retrieval violates SRP.
  ```javascript
  class UserService {
      authenticate(user) { /* authentication logic */ }
      getUserData(userId) { /* data retrieval logic */ }
  }
  ```
- **Refactored Example**: Split into two classes, `AuthService` and `UserDataService`.
  ```javascript
  class AuthService {
      authenticate(user) { /* authentication logic */ }
  }
  
  class UserDataService {
      getUserData(userId) { /* data retrieval logic */ }
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **SonarQube**: Configure to enforce SOLID principles checks.
  ```yaml
  sonar.java.source=11
  sonar.java.target=11
  sonar.issue.ignore.multicriteria=e1
  sonar.issue.ignore.multicriteria.e1.ruleKey=squid:S00100
  sonar.issue.ignore.multicriteria.e1.resourceKey=**/*.java
  ```

## Real-World Patterns
### Pattern Name: Strategy Pattern
- **When to Apply**: When you need to define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define a strategy interface.
  2. Implement concrete strategies.
  3. Use a context class to delegate behavior to the selected strategy.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  interface PaymentStrategy {
      void pay(int amount);
  }

  class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
      public void pay(int amount) { /* credit card payment logic */ }
  }

  class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
      public void pay(int amount) { /* PayPal payment logic */ }
  }

  class ShoppingCart {
      private PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy;

      public void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy paymentStrategy) {
          this.paymentStrategy = paymentStrategy;
      }

      public void checkout(int amount) {
          paymentStrategy.pay(amount);
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Factory Pattern
- **When to Apply**: When the exact type of object to create is determined at runtime.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define a factory interface.
  2. Implement concrete factories for creating objects.
  3. Use the factory to create instances.
- **Code Example**:
  ```python
  class Shape:
      def draw(self):
          pass

  class Circle(Shape):
      def draw(self):
          return "Drawing a Circle"

  class Square(Shape):
      def draw(self):
          return "Drawing a Square"

  class ShapeFactory:
      @staticmethod
      def get_shape(shape_type):
          if shape_type == "CIRCLE":
              return Circle()
          elif shape_type == "SQUARE":
              return Square()
          return None

  shape = ShapeFactory.get_shape("CIRCLE")
  print(shape.draw())  # Output: Drawing a Circle
  ```

### Pattern Name: Observer Pattern
- **When to Apply**: When an object needs to notify other objects about changes in its state.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define an observer interface.
  2. Implement concrete observers.
  3. Use a subject class to manage observers and notify them of changes.
- **Code Example**:
  ```csharp
  public interface IObserver {
      void Update();
  }

  public class ConcreteObserver : IObserver {
      public void Update() {
          // Handle update
      }
  }

  public class Subject {
      private List<IObserver> observers = new List<IObserver>();

      public void Attach(IObserver observer) {
          observers.Add(observer);
      }

      public void Notify() {
          foreach (var observer in observers) {
              observer.Update();
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework
### Evaluation Criteria
- Code maintainability and readability.
- Adherence to SOLID principles.
