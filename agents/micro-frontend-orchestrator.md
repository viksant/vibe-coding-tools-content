## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding

Micro frontend architecture lets teams develop and deploy frontend applications independently, speeding up releases and boosting scalability. The main idea is to break down monolithic frontend applications into smaller, manageable pieces, each crafted by different teams. This architecture uses **module federation** to load micro frontends dynamically at runtime, allowing shared dependencies and cutting down the overall bundle size.

**Module federation** is a key feature of webpack that enables multiple applications to share code and dependencies smoothly. By defining shared libraries and exposing modules, developers ensure that only one instance of a library loads, reducing duplication and enhancing load times. This method is especially useful in large-scale applications where various teams work on different frontend sections.

**Cross-app communication** plays a vital role in micro frontends. You can use techniques like event buses or shared state management libraries (such as Redux or Zustand) to enable communication between micro frontends, ensuring users enjoy a cohesive experience. Tools like **single-spa** and **qiankun** help manage multiple micro frontends, handling routing and orchestrating their lifecycle events.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Over-Engineering**: Breaking applications down too much can lead to unnecessary complexity.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Not managing shared dependencies can result in version mismatches and runtime errors.
- **Poor Communication**: Lack of clear communication between micro frontends can lead to inconsistent user experiences.
- **Style Conflicts**: Ignoring style isolation can cause CSS clashes, leading to visual inconsistencies.
- **Performance Issues**: Loading too many micro frontends at once can slow down performance; lazy loading strategies can help.
- **Inadequate Governance**: Without clear guidelines for development, practices can become inconsistent across teams.
- **Ignoring Build Optimization**: Not optimizing the build process can result in large bundles.

### Industry Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Boundaries**: Set clear boundaries for each micro frontend to avoid overlap.
2. **Use Module Federation**: Take advantage of webpack's module federation for effective dependency sharing.
3. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Load micro frontends only as needed to enhance initial load times.
4. **Establish a Shared Design System**: Create a design system to maintain visual consistency.
5. **Utilize Versioning**: Manage shared library versions carefully to prevent conflicts.
6. **Monitor Performance**: Use tools to track how micro frontends impact load times and user experience.
7. **Automate Testing**: Implement automated testing strategies to ensure each micro frontend works properly both in isolation and within the larger application.
8. **Document Architecture**: Keep clear documentation of the micro frontend architecture and governance practices.
9. **Use Feature Flags**: Utilize feature flags for controlled rollouts of new micro frontends.
10. **Conduct Regular Reviews**: Regularly review and refactor micro frontends to keep them maintainable and performant.

### Performance Metrics

- **Load Time**: Check how long it takes for micro frontends to load and become interactive.
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor the size of each micro frontend bundle to ensure efficient loading.
- **Error Rates**: Track how often errors occur in micro frontends.
- **User Engagement**: Analyze user engagement to evaluate the impact of micro frontends on the user experience.
- **Dependency Load Times**: Measure load times of shared dependencies to identify bottlenecks.

10. **Automate Testing and CI/CD**: Integrate automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration.
    - *Why*: This ensures code quality and rapid deployment.

### Code Standards

- **Avoid Global State**: Use local state management within each micro frontend to prevent unintended side effects.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Follow a consistent naming convention for components and modules.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in each micro frontend to manage failures gracefully.

### Tool Configuration

- **Webpack Module Federation Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  // webpack.config.js
  const ModuleFederationPlugin = require("webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin");

  module.exports = {
    plugins: [
      new ModuleFederationPlugin({
        name: "app1",
        filename: "remoteEntry.js",
        exposes: {
          './Component': './src/Component',
        },
        shared: {
          react: { singleton: true, eager: true },
          "react-dom": { singleton: true, eager: true },
        },
      }),
    ],
  };
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Dynamic Micro Frontend Loading

- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to load micro frontends based on user interactions or specific routes.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define routes in your main application.
  2. Use dynamic imports to load micro frontends based on the route.
  3. Implement loading indicators while the micro frontend is being fetched.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const loadMicroFrontend = async (microFrontend) => {
    const { default: MicroFrontend } = await import(`./${microFrontend}`);
    return <MicroFrontend />;
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Shared State Management

- **When to Apply**: This pattern works best when multiple micro frontends need to share application state.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a shared state management library (e.g., using Redux).
  2. Expose the state management library via module federation.
  3. Each micro frontend subscribes to the shared state.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  // sharedState.js
  import { createStore } from 'redux';

  const initialState = { user: null };
  const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'SET_USER':
        return { ...state, user: action.payload };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  export const store = createStore(reducer);
  ```

### Pattern Name: CSS Isolation

- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when developing micro frontends that need to avoid CSS conflicts.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use CSS Modules or styled-components for styling.
  2. Ensure each micro frontend has its own scoped styles.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  /* Component.module.css */
  .button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Performance Impact**: Assess how each architectural decision affects load times and user experience.
- **Team Autonomy**: Consider how decisions impact the ability of teams to work independently.
- **Scalability**: Evaluate how well the architecture can grow with the application.

### Trade-off Analysis

- **Granularity vs. Complexity**: More granular micro frontends can lead to complexity in management.
- **Shared Code vs. Independence**: Sharing code can reduce duplication but may create tight coupling.

### Decision Trees

- **When to Use Module Federation vs. Single-Spa**:
  - Use **Module Federation** for dynamic loading and shared dependencies.
  - Use **Single-Spa** for a more structured approach to managing multiple micro frontends.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
