## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Developing browser extensions requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying architecture of each browser's extension system. The **WebExtension API** provides a standardized way to build extensions that work across multiple browsers, allowing developers to write code once and deploy it everywhere. Key components include `manifest.json`, which defines the extension's metadata and permissions, and background scripts that manage long-running tasks and event listeners. 

Manifest V3 introduces significant changes, such as the move from background pages to service workers, enhancing performance and security. Understanding these changes is critical for developing efficient extensions that comply with modern standards. Additionally, managing cross-origin requests and permissions is essential for accessing external resources securely while maintaining user trust.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Manifest V3 Changes**: Failing to adapt to the new service worker model can lead to performance issues.
2. **Overlooking Permissions**: Requesting excessive permissions can lead to rejection from the browser store.
3. **Neglecting Cross-Browser Testing**: Not testing extensions on all target browsers can result in functionality issues.
4. **Inadequate Error Handling**: Poor error handling can lead to a frustrating user experience and crashes.
5. **Not Following Store Guidelines**: Non-compliance with store policies can result in extension removal.
6. **Inefficient Storage Management**: Mismanaging storage can lead to performance bottlenecks and data loss.
7. **Ignoring Security Best Practices**: Failing to implement CSP (Content Security Policy) can expose extensions to vulnerabilities.

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Use Manifest V3**: Always use the latest manifest version for improved performance and security.
2. **Limit Permissions**: Request only the permissions necessary for your extensionâ€™s functionality.
3. **Implement CSP**: Use Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks and enhance security.
4. **Optimize Background Scripts**: Use service workers instead of persistent background pages to reduce resource consumption.
5. **Test Across Browsers**: Regularly test your extension on all target browsers to ensure compatibility.
6. **Utilize Storage APIs Wisely**: Use `chrome.storage` for efficient data management and synchronization.
7. **Document Your Code**: Maintain clear documentation for maintainability and onboarding new developers.
8. **Monitor Performance**: Use performance profiling tools to identify and resolve bottlenecks.
9. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement robust error handling to improve user experience.
10. **Stay Updated**: Keep abreast of changes in browser extension APIs and store policies.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Measure the time taken for the extension to load and become functional.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during extension operation.
- **Error Rate**: Track the frequency of errors encountered by users.
- **User Engagement**: Analyze user interaction metrics to gauge extension effectiveness.
- **Compliance Rate**: Measure the success rate of passing store reviews on the first submission.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Use Manifest V3**: This ensures compliance with the latest standards and improves performance.
   - *Why*: It enhances security and optimizes resource usage.
   
2. **Request Minimal Permissions**: Only ask for permissions that are absolutely necessary.
   - *Why*: Reduces the risk of rejection from the browser store and builds user trust.

3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define a strict CSP in your manifest.
   - *Why*: Protects against XSS attacks and enhances security.

4. **Use Asynchronous APIs**: Prefer asynchronous methods for API calls to avoid blocking the main thread.
   - *Why*: Improves responsiveness and user experience.

5. **Optimize Event Listeners**: Use event delegation and avoid attaching multiple listeners unnecessarily.
   - *Why*: Reduces memory usage and improves performance.

6. **Handle Storage Efficiently**: Use `chrome.storage.sync` for user-specific data and `chrome.storage.local` for non-sensitive data.
   - *Why*: Ensures data is accessible across devices while optimizing performance.

7. **Test with Real Users**: Conduct user testing to gather feedback before final release.
   - *Why*: Identifies usability issues and improves the extension's effectiveness.

8. **Use Service Workers for Background Tasks**: Implement service workers for handling background processes.
   - *Why*: Reduces resource consumption and improves performance.

9. **Implement Error Logging**: Use tools like Sentry for logging errors in production.
   - *Why*: Helps in diagnosing issues and improving stability.

10. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries and dependencies up to date.
    - *Why*: Ensures security and access to the latest features.

### Code Standards
- **Avoid Global Variables**: Use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) to encapsulate code.
  ```javascript
  (function() {
      // Your code here
  })();
  ```
- **Use Promises for Asynchronous Code**: Ensure proper error handling with `.catch()`.
  ```javascript
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
  ```
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions.
- **Comment Your Code**: Provide clear comments for complex logic.
- **Lint Your Code**: Use ESLint to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Tool Configuration
- **ESLint Configuration**:
  ```json
  {
      "env": {
          "browser": true,
          "es6": true
      },
      "extends": "eslint:recommended",
      "parserOptions": {
          "ecmaVersion": 2020
      },
      "rules": {
          "no-console": "warn",
          "prefer-const": "error"
      }
  }
  ```
- **Manifest V3 Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "manifest_version": 3,
      "name": "My Extension",
      "version": "1.0",
      "permissions": ["storage"],
      "background": {
          "service_worker": "background.js"
      },
      "action": {
          "default_popup": "popup.html"
      }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Content Script Injection
- **When to Apply**: Use when you need to manipulate web pages directly.
- **Implementation Details**: Define content scripts in the manifest and use messaging to communicate with background scripts.
- **Code Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "content_scripts": [
          {
              "matches": ["*://*.example.com/*"],
              "js": ["content.js"]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Cross-Browser Compatibility Layer
- **When to Apply**: When developing extensions that need to function across Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.
- **Implementation Details**: Use feature detection and polyfills to handle differences in APIs.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const browser = window.browser || window.chrome;
  browser.storage.local.get('key').then(result => {
      console.log(result.key);
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Background Service Worker
- **When to Apply**: For tasks that need to run independently of the user interface.
- **Implementation Details**: Use service workers to handle events and manage state.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  self.addEventListener('install', event => {
      console.log('Service Worker installing.');
  });
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure load times and responsiveness.
- **Security**: Assess vulnerability exposure and compliance with security standards.
- **User Experience**: Evaluate usability and engagement metrics.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure functionality across all target browsers.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Performance vs. Features**: Adding features may impact performance; prioritize essential features.
- **Security vs. Usability**: Stricter security may hinder usability; find a balance that maintains user trust.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Service Workers vs. Background Pages**:
