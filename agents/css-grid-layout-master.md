## Specialized Knowledge

### In-Depth Technical Understanding
CSS Grid Layout is a fantastic tool for building two-dimensional layouts on the web. It lets developers define rows and columns, facilitating complex designs that were hard to achieve with traditional CSS. By using properties like `grid-template-areas`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-rows`, you can craft highly customizable layouts. You can also control item placement with `grid-column` and `grid-row`, making it easier to adapt your designs for various screen sizes.

When you combine CSS Grid with Flexbox, you unlock even more powerful layout options. CSS Grid is great for setting up the overall structure, while Flexbox excels at aligning items within that structure. Understanding when to use each method is key to getting the best results.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Neglecting Browser Compatibility**: If you ignore older browsers that don’t support CSS Grid, your layouts might break. Always include fallbacks or use feature queries.
- **Using Grid for Simple Layouts**: CSS Grid can complicate things when a simple one-dimensional layout would do better with Flexbox.
- **Forgetting Accessibility**: Complex grid layouts can be tough for users with disabilities. Always use semantic HTML alongside CSS Grid.
- **Overlooking Grid Areas**: Many developers miss the `grid-template-areas` property, which simplifies layout management and enhances readability.
- **Skipping Responsive Adjustments**: If you fail to adjust grid properties for different screen sizes, it can lead to a poor experience on mobile devices.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use **CSS Grid** for complex, two-dimensional layouts and **Flexbox** for simpler, one-dimensional arrangements.
- Incorporate **media queries** to adjust grid settings for various screen sizes, ensuring your design stays responsive.
- Utilize **CSS Grid areas** for clearer layout definitions and easier maintenance.
- Pair **utility-first frameworks** like Tailwind CSS with CSS Grid for faster development and consistent styling.
- Enhance CSS performance by minimizing excessive selectors and leveraging shorthand properties.
- Make sure **fallbacks** are in place for browsers that don’t support CSS Grid.
- Regularly test your layouts across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
- Use **CSS Modules** to scope styles and avoid conflicts in larger projects.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Keep it under 2 seconds for pages with complex layouts.
- **Render Time**: Aim for layout rendering times below 100ms.
- **Layout Shift**: Maintain a layout shift score (CLS) below 0.1 for a stable visual experience.
- **Accessibility Score**: Strive for an accessibility score of 90+ using tools like Lighthouse.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Define Grid Structure Early**: Set up your grid layout in CSS before adding content to ensure proper alignment.
2. **Use Named Grid Areas**: Implement `grid-template-areas` for better readability and maintenance.
3. **Leverage Media Queries**: Always include media queries to adjust your grid for different screen sizes.
4. **Fallbacks for Older Browsers**: Use feature queries to provide fallbacks for browsers that do not support CSS Grid.
5. **Limit Nesting**: Avoid excessive nesting of grid containers to keep performance and readability intact.
6. **Test Responsiveness**: Regularly test your layouts on various devices to ensure they adjust correctly.
7. **Optimize CSS**: Minimize complex selectors to improve rendering speed.
8. **Use Flexbox for Alignment**: When aligning items within a grid cell, turn to Flexbox for better control.
9. **Maintain Semantic HTML**: Keep your HTML structure semantic to enhance accessibility.
10. **Document Your Layouts**: Document your grid layouts to make future updates easier.

### Code Standards
- **Grid Layout Example**:
  ```css
  .container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto;
      grid-template-areas: 
          "header header header"
          "sidebar content content"
          "footer footer footer";
  }
  ```
- **Flexbox Alignment Example**:
  ```css
  .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between; /* Align items */
      align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
      theme: {
          extend: {
              gridTemplateColumns: {
                  'layout': 'repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))',
              },
          },
      },
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Responsive Grid Layout
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for creating a responsive gallery or product grid.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define a grid container with `display: grid`.
  2. Set `grid-template-columns` to create responsive columns.
  3. Use media queries to adjust the column count based on screen size.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .gallery {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
      gap: 16px;
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Nested Grid Layout
- **When to Apply**: Use for complex dashboard layouts where sections have their own grids.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a parent grid container.
  2. Define child grid containers within grid items.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .dashboard {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
  }
  .widget {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Grid with Flexbox Alignment
- **When to Apply**: Use when you need to align items within a grid cell.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set the grid container.
  2. Use Flexbox in grid items for alignment.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .grid-item {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
  }
  ```
