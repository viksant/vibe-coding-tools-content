## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool for creating two-dimensional layouts on the web. It allows developers to define rows and columns, enabling complex designs that were previously difficult to achieve with traditional CSS. By utilizing properties such as `grid-template-areas`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-rows`, developers can create highly customizable layouts. Furthermore, the ability to control item placement using `grid-column` and `grid-row` makes it easier to adapt designs for different screen sizes.

Combining CSS Grid with Flexbox can yield even more powerful layout solutions. While CSS Grid excels at defining overall structure, Flexbox is ideal for aligning items within those structures. This synergy allows for intricate designs that maintain responsiveness without sacrificing performance. Understanding when to use each method is crucial for achieving optimal results.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Browser Compatibility**: Failing to account for older browsers that do not support CSS Grid can lead to broken layouts. Always include fallbacks or use feature queries.
- **Overusing Grid for Simple Layouts**: Using CSS Grid for simple one-dimensional layouts can lead to unnecessary complexity. Flexbox may be a better choice in these cases.
- **Neglecting Accessibility**: Complex grid layouts can hinder accessibility if not properly structured. Ensure semantic HTML is used alongside CSS Grid.
- **Not Utilizing Grid Areas**: Many developers overlook the `grid-template-areas` property, which simplifies layout management and improves readability.
- **Forgetting Responsive Adjustments**: Failing to adjust grid properties for different screen sizes can result in poor user experiences on mobile devices.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use **CSS Grid** for complex, two-dimensional layouts while reserving **Flexbox** for simpler, one-dimensional arrangements.
- Implement **media queries** to adjust grid properties for various screen sizes, ensuring a responsive design.
- Utilize **CSS Grid areas** for clearer layout definitions and easier maintenance.
- Combine **utility-first frameworks** like Tailwind CSS with CSS Grid for rapid development and consistent styling.
- Optimize CSS performance by minimizing the use of excessive selectors and leveraging shorthand properties.
- Ensure **fallbacks** are in place for browsers that do not support CSS Grid.
- Regularly test layouts across multiple browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
- Use **CSS Modules** to scope styles and prevent conflicts in larger projects.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Aim for a load time of under 2 seconds for pages utilizing complex layouts.
- **Render Time**: Measure the time taken for the layout to render, ideally under 100ms.
- **Layout Shift**: Maintain a layout shift score (CLS) of less than 0.1 to ensure a stable visual experience.
- **Accessibility Score**: Strive for an accessibility score of 90+ on tools like Lighthouse.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Define Grid Structure Early**: Establish your grid layout in the CSS before adding content to ensure proper alignment.
2. **Use Named Grid Areas**: Implement `grid-template-areas` for better readability and maintainability of your layout.
3. **Leverage Media Queries**: Always include media queries to adjust your grid for different screen sizes.
4. **Fallbacks for Older Browsers**: Use feature queries to provide fallbacks for browsers that do not support CSS Grid.
5. **Limit Nesting**: Avoid excessive nesting of grid containers to maintain performance and readability.
6. **Test Responsiveness**: Regularly test your layouts on various devices to ensure they adapt appropriately.
7. **Optimize CSS**: Minimize the use of complex selectors to improve rendering speed.
8. **Use Flexbox for Alignment**: When aligning items within a grid cell, use Flexbox for better control and alignment.
9. **Maintain Semantic HTML**: Ensure that your HTML structure is semantic to enhance accessibility.
10. **Document Your Layouts**: Keep documentation of your grid layouts to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

### Code Standards
- **Grid Layout Example**:
  ```css
  .container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
      grid-template-rows: auto;
      grid-template-areas: 
          "header header header"
          "sidebar content content"
          "footer footer footer";
  }
  ```
- **Flexbox Alignment Example**:
  ```css
  .flex-container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between; /* Align items */
      align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Tailwind CSS Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
      theme: {
          extend: {
              gridTemplateColumns: {
                  'layout': 'repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr))',
              },
          },
      },
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Responsive Grid Layout
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for creating a responsive gallery or product grid.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define a grid container with `display: grid`.
  2. Set `grid-template-columns` to create responsive columns.
  3. Use media queries to adjust the column count based on screen size.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .gallery {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
      gap: 16px;
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Nested Grid Layout
- **When to Apply**: Use for complex dashboard layouts where sections have their own grids.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a parent grid container.
  2. Define child grid containers within grid items.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .dashboard {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
  }
  .widget {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Grid with Flexbox Alignment
- **When to Apply**: Use when you need to align items within a grid cell.
