## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
The Vue 3 Composition API introduces a new way to structure components by allowing developers to encapsulate logic into reusable functions called **composables**. This approach enhances code organization and reusability, making it easier to manage complex state and side effects. The reactivity system is built on **Proxy** objects, which provide a more efficient way to track dependencies and trigger updates. Understanding how to leverage `ref`, `reactive`, and `computed` properties is crucial for building responsive applications.

Additionally, the Composition API allows for better TypeScript integration, enabling developers to define types for their reactive state and props, which leads to improved maintainability and fewer runtime errors. By utilizing the `setup` function, developers can access lifecycle hooks directly, providing more control over component behavior.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overusing `ref`**: Developers often use `ref` for all reactive data, leading to unnecessary complexity. Use `reactive` for objects to maintain a flat structure.
2. **Neglecting Cleanup**: Failing to clean up side effects in lifecycle hooks can lead to memory leaks. Always return a cleanup function from `onBeforeUnmount`.
3. **Improper Dependency Management**: Not specifying dependencies in `watch` or `computed` can lead to stale data. Always ensure dependencies are correctly tracked.
4. **Mixing Options API with Composition API**: While possible, mixing the two can create confusion. Stick to one API style per component for clarity.
5. **Ignoring Performance**: Not optimizing reactivity can lead to performance bottlenecks. Use `shallowReactive` or `shallowRef` when deep reactivity is not needed.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **composables** to encapsulate logic and state management for better reusability.
2. Prefer **Pinia** over Vuex for new projects due to its simpler API and better TypeScript support.
3. Implement **TypeScript** for type safety and improved developer experience.
4. Utilize **Vite** for faster development and hot module replacement.
5. Keep components small and focused; each should ideally handle one responsibility.
6. Use **watchEffect** for reactive side effects that need to respond to multiple reactive sources.
7. Leverage **async setup** for handling asynchronous data fetching within the `setup` function.
8. Optimize rendering with **v-if** and **v-show** to control visibility based on conditions.
9. Use **provide/inject** for dependency injection to share state across components without prop drilling.
10. Regularly profile and monitor performance using Vue Devtools to identify bottlenecks.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Measure the time taken for components to render.
- **Reactivity Performance**: Monitor the responsiveness of the UI to state changes.
- **Bundle Size**: Keep track of the size of the application bundle to ensure quick load times.
- **Memory Usage**: Analyze memory consumption to prevent leaks and optimize performance.
- **User Interaction Latency**: Measure the time between user actions and UI updates.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Encapsulate Logic**: Always encapsulate shared logic in composables to promote reusability.
2. **Use `reactive` for Objects**: Prefer `reactive` for complex objects instead of multiple `ref`s.
3. **Cleanup in Lifecycle Hooks**: Always return a cleanup function in `onBeforeUnmount` to prevent memory leaks.
4. **Track Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are listed in `watch` and `computed` to avoid stale data.
5. **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: Do not perform side effects in the render function; use lifecycle hooks instead.
6. **Use `v-if` for Conditional Rendering**: Use `v-if` for elements that may not be rendered to save resources.
7. **Limit Reactive Properties**: Keep the number of reactive properties to a minimum to enhance performance.
8. **Use `watchEffect` for Side Effects**: Utilize `watchEffect` for side effects that depend on multiple reactive sources.
9. **Leverage TypeScript**: Always define types for props and state to enhance maintainability.
10. **Profile Regularly**: Use Vue Devtools to profile components and identify performance bottlenecks.

### Code Standards
- **Use Composables**: 
  ```javascript
  // composables/useCounter.js
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  export function useCounter() {
      const count = ref(0);
      const increment = () => count.value++;
      return { count, increment };
  }
  ```
  
- **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: 
  ```javascript
  // In your component
  setup() {
      const { count, increment } = useCounter();
      return { count, increment };
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Vite Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
  import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';

  export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [vue()],
      server: {
          open: true,
      },
  });
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: State Management with Pinia
- **When to Apply**: Use when building new Vue 3 applications that require state management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Install Pinia: `npm install pinia`
  2. Create a store:
     ```javascript
     // stores/counterStore.js
     import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

     export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
         state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
         actions: {
             increment() {
                 this.count++;
             },
         },
     });
     ```
  3. Use the store in a component:
     ```javascript
     // In your component
     setup() {
         const counterStore = useCounterStore();
         return { counterStore };
     }
     ```

### Pattern Name: Composable for API Calls
- **When to Apply**: When you need to fetch data from an API in a reusable manner.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a composable:
     ```javascript
     // composables/useFetch.js
     import { ref } from 'vue';

     export function useFetch(url) {
         const data = ref(null);
         const error = ref(null);

         const fetchData = async () => {
             try {
                 const response = await fetch(url);
                 if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                 data.value = await response.json();
             } catch (err) {
                 error.value = err.message;
             }
         };

         fetchData();
         return { data, error };
     }
     ```
  2. Use in a component:
     ```javascript
     // In your component
     setup() {
         const { data, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');
         return { data, error };
     }
     ```

### Pattern Name: Lifecycle Management
- **When to Apply**: When managing side effects in components.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use lifecycle hooks:
     ```javascript
     setup() {
         const count = ref(0);

         onMounted(() => {
             console.log('Component is mounted');
         });

         onBeforeUnmount(() => {
             console.log('Cleanup before unmounting');
         });

         return { count };
     }
     ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure render times and responsiveness.
- **Maintainability**: Assess the ease of understanding and modifying the code.
- **Scalability**: Evaluate how well the architecture supports future growth.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Vuex vs. Pinia**: Pinia offers a simpler API and better TypeScript support but may have less community support compared to Vuex.
- **Composition API vs. Options API**: The Composition API provides better reusability and logic encapsulation, while the Options API is more familiar to those coming from Vue 2.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Composables**: 
  - If logic is reused across multiple components → Create a composable.
  - If logic is specific to a single component → Keep it within the component.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach          | Cost                        | Benefit                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Using Pinia       | Learning curve for new API | Simplicity and TypeScript support |
| Composition API   | Requires refactoring        | Enhanced reusability and maintainability |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Composables**: Create composables that can accept parameters to modify their behavior based on context.
2. **Custom Directives**: Implement custom directives for reusable DOM manipulations.
3. **SSR with Nuxt**: Leverage Nuxt.js for server-side rendering to improve SEO and performance.
4. **Type-Safe Composables**: Use TypeScript to define types for composables, ensuring type safety across your application.
5. **Reactive Forms**: Build reactive forms using the Composition API to handle complex form logic and validation.
6. **Global State Management**: Use Pinia for global state management while maintaining modularity in your application.
7. **Performance Profiling**: Utilize Vue Devtools to profile component performance and identify bottlenecks.
