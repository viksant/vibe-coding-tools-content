## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
The Vue 3 Composition API offers a new way to structure your components. It allows you to bundle logic into reusable functions, known as **composables**. This approach improves code organization and reusability, simplifying the management of complex state and side effects. The reactivity system relies on **Proxy** objects, which efficiently track dependencies and trigger updates. Mastering `ref`, `reactive`, and `computed` properties is essential for creating responsive applications.

The Composition API also enhances TypeScript integration, letting you specify types for your reactive state and props. This leads to better maintainability and reduces runtime errors. By using the `setup` function, you can directly access lifecycle hooks, giving you greater control over component behavior.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overusing `ref`**: It's tempting to use `ref` for all reactive data, but this can complicate things unnecessarily. Instead, use `reactive` for objects to keep your structure straightforward.
2. **Neglecting Cleanup**: Forgetting to clean up side effects in lifecycle hooks can result in memory leaks. Always return a cleanup function from `onBeforeUnmount`.
3. **Improper Dependency Management**: If you don’t specify dependencies in `watch` or `computed`, you risk getting stale data. Make sure to track dependencies correctly.
4. **Mixing Options API with Composition API**: While it’s allowed, mixing the two can confuse developers. Stick to one style per component for clarity.
5. **Ignoring Performance**: Not optimizing reactivity can slow down your application. Use `shallowReactive` or `shallowRef` when deep reactivity isn’t necessary.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **composables** to bundle logic and state management for improved reusability.
2. Choose **Pinia** over Vuex for new projects because of its simpler API and better support for TypeScript.
3. Employ **TypeScript** for type safety and a better developer experience.
4. Leverage **Vite** for quicker development and hot module replacement.
5. Keep components small and focused; each should ideally have one responsibility.
6. Use **watchEffect** for reactive side effects that depend on multiple sources.
7. Implement **async setup** for fetching data within the `setup` function.
8. Optimize rendering with **v-if** and **v-show** to manage visibility based on conditions.
9. Use **provide/inject** for sharing state across components without prop drilling.
10. Regularly profile and monitor performance using Vue Devtools to spot bottlenecks.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Track how long components take to render.
- **Reactivity Performance**: Observe how responsive the UI is to state changes.
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor the size of your application bundle to ensure fast load times.
- **Memory Usage**: Check memory consumption to avoid leaks and ensure performance.
- **User Interaction Latency**: Measure the time between user actions and UI updates.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Encapsulate Logic**: Always wrap shared logic in composables to promote reusability.
2. **Use `reactive` for Objects**: Opt for `reactive` for complex objects instead of multiple `ref`s.
3. **Cleanup in Lifecycle Hooks**: Always provide a cleanup function in `onBeforeUnmount` to prevent memory leaks.
4. **Track Dependencies**: List all dependencies in `watch` and `computed` to avoid stale data.
5. **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: Steer clear of side effects in the render function; use lifecycle hooks instead.
6. **Use `v-if` for Conditional Rendering**: Use `v-if` for elements that might not render to save resources.
7. **Limit Reactive Properties**: Keep the number of reactive properties low to improve performance.
8. **Use `watchEffect` for Side Effects**: Implement `watchEffect` for side effects that depend on multiple reactive sources.
9. **Leverage TypeScript**: Always define types for props and state to improve maintainability.
10. **Profile Regularly**: Use Vue Devtools to evaluate components and find performance issues.

### Code Standards
- **Use Composables**: 
  ```javascript
  // composables/useCounter.js
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  export function useCounter() {
      const count = ref(0);
      const increment = () => count.value++;
      return { count, increment };
  }
  ```
  
- **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: 
  ```javascript
  // In your component
  setup() {
      const { count, increment } = useCounter();
      return { count, increment };
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Vite Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  // vite.config.js
  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
  import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue';

  export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [vue()],
      server: {
          open: true,
      },
  });
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: State Management with Pinia
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for new Vue 3 applications requiring state management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Install Pinia: `npm install pinia`
  2. Create a store:
     ```javascript
     // stores/counterStore.js
     import { defineStore } from 'pinia';

     export const useCounterStore = defineStore('counter', {
         state: () => ({ count: 0 }),
         actions: {
             increment() {
                 this.count++;
             },
         },
     });
     ```
  3. Use the store in a component:
     ```javascript
     // In your component
     setup() {
         const counterStore = useCounterStore();
         return { counterStore };
     }
     ```

### Pattern Name: Composable for API Calls
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you want to fetch data from an API in a reusable way.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a composable:
     ```javascript
     // composables/useFetch.js
     import { ref } from 'vue';

     export function useFetch(url) {
         const data = ref(null);
         const error = ref(null);

         const fetchData = async () => {
             try {
                 const response = await fetch(url);
                 if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                 data.value = await response.json();
             } catch (err) {
                 error.value = err.message;
             }
         };

         fetchData();
         return { data, error };
     }
     ```
  2. Use in a component:
     ```javascript
     // In your component
     setup() {
         const { data, error } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');
         return { data, error };
     }
     ```

### Pattern Name: Lifecycle Management
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for managing side effects in components.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use lifecycle hooks:
     ```javascript
     setup() {
         const count = ref(0);

         onMounted(() => {
             console.log('Component is mounted');
         });

         onBeforeUnmount(() => {
             console.log('Cleanup before unmounting');
         });

         return { count };
     }
     ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Look at render times and responsiveness.
- **Maintainability**: Assess how easy it is to understand and modify the code.
- **Scalability**: Check how well the architecture can grow in the future.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Vuex vs. Pinia**: Pinia provides a simpler API and better TypeScript support, but Vuex may have a larger community.
- **Composition API vs. Options API**: The Composition API excels in reusability and logic encapsulation, while the Options API might feel more familiar to Vue 2 users.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Composables**: 
  - If you have logic reused across multiple components → Create a composable.
  - If the logic is unique to a single component → Keep it within that component.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach          | Cost                        | Benefit                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Using Pinia       | Learning curve for new API | Simplicity and TypeScript support |
| Composition API   | Requires refactoring        | Improved reusability and maintainability |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Composables**: Create composables that adjust their behavior based on context.
2. **Custom Directives**: Implement custom directives for consistent DOM manipulations.
3. **SSR with Nuxt**: Use Nuxt.js for server-side rendering to boost SEO and performance.
4. **Type-Safe Composables**: Define types for composables using TypeScript to ensure safety across your application.
5. **Reactive Forms**: Build reactive forms using the Composition API to tackle complex form logic and validation.
6. **Global State Management**: Consider Pinia for managing global state while maintaining modularity.
7. **Performance Profiling**: Use Vue Devtools to analyze component performance and locate any bottlenecks.

## Troubleshooting Guide

  - **Solution**: Ensure properties are defined using `ref` or `reactive`.

- **Symptom**: API call fails.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect URL or network issues.
  - **Solution**: Check the URL and implement error handling to log the issue.

- **Symptom**: Memory leaks detected.
  - **Cause**: Not cleaning up side effects in lifecycle hooks.
  - **Solution**: Return cleanup functions in `onBeforeUnmount`.

- **Symptom**: Slow performance with large datasets.
  - **Cause**: Inefficient reactivity or rendering.
  - **Solution**: Use pagination or virtual scrolling techniques.

- **Symptom**: Type errors in TypeScript.
  - **Cause**: Incorrect type definitions.
  - **Solution**: Review and correct type annotations.

- **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in computed properties.
  - **Cause**: Dependencies not tracked properly.
  - **Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are included in the computed function.

- **Symptom**: Component fails to mount.
  - **Cause**: Errors in the setup function.
