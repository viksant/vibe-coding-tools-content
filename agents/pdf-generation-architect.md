6. **Use Vector Graphics When Possible**: They scale better and help reduce file size.
7. **Validate PDF Output**: Use tools like PDF/A validation to ensure compliance with standards.
8. **Implement Error Handling**: Catch and log errors during PDF generation to aid troubleshooting.
9. **Leverage Asynchronous Processing**: For large PDFs, utilize asynchronous processing to enhance user experience.
10. **Document Your Code**: Keep thorough documentation for future reference and team collaboration.
11. **Use Version Control**: Manage your PDF generation scripts in version control for better oversight.
12. **Monitor Performance Metrics**: Regularly check file sizes and rendering times to identify areas for improvement.
13. **Avoid Hardcoding Values**: Use variables for dimensions and styles to simplify adjustments.
14. **Keep Libraries Updated**: Regularly check for library updates to leverage improvements.
15. **Follow Accessibility Guidelines**: Ensure all generated PDFs meet accessibility standards for inclusivity.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern**: Hardcoding dimensions can lead to layout issues. Instead, use relative units.
- **Pattern**: Centralize your configuration for fonts and styles to maintain consistency across documents.

Example:
```javascript
const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument({
  size: 'A4',
  margin: 50,
});

// Use a centralized style object
const styles = {
  header: { fontSize: 20, font: 'Helvetica-Bold' },
  body: { fontSize: 12, font: 'Helvetica' },
};

// Apply styles
pdfDoc.font(styles.header.font).fontSize(styles.header.fontSize).text('Document Title');
pdfDoc.font(styles.body.font).fontSize(styles.body.fontSize).text('This is the body text.');
```

### Tool Configuration
- **Puppeteer Configuration**:
```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: true,
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'],
});
```
- **PDFKit Configuration**:
```javascript
const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument({
  autoFirstPage: false,
});
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Dynamic Report Generation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when generating reports that need real-time data integration.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Fetch data from the API.
  2. Format the data for presentation.
  3. Use a templating engine to create the PDF layout.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
async function generateReport(data) {
  const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
  data.forEach(item => {
    pdfDoc.addPage().text(`Report Item: ${item.title}`);
  });
  pdfDoc.end();
}
```

### Pattern Name: Multi-Page Document Creation
- **When to Apply**: Use this when creating documents that exceed one page.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Track the content length.
  2. Manage page breaks programmatically.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const content = getContent(); // Assume this returns a long string
const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
const pageLimit = 800; // Example limit

content.split('\n').forEach(line => {
  if (pdfDoc.y > pageLimit) {
    pdfDoc.addPage();
  }
  pdfDoc.text(line);
});
pdfDoc.end();
```

### Pattern Name: Image Handling in PDFs
- **When to Apply**: Use this when including images in PDF documents.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Optimize images beforehand.
  2. Use appropriate dimensions to maintain aspect ratio.
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const pdfDoc = new PDFDocument();
pdfDoc.image('path/to/image.jpg', {
  fit: [500, 400],
  align: 'center',
  valign: 'center',
});
pdfDoc.end();
```
