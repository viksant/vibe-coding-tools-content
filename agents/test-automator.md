- Test maintenance effort and flakiness rates.
- User satisfaction scores related to application performance.
- Response times for critical user journeys during load testing.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Write failing tests first** to clarify expected behavior.
2. **Keep tests isolated** to ensure they do not depend on each other.
3. **Refactor tests regularly** to maintain clarity and relevance.
4. **Integrate tests into CI/CD** to ensure continuous validation.
5. **Use descriptive naming conventions** for tests to convey intent.
6. **Monitor test execution times** to identify performance bottlenecks.
7. **Employ version control** for test scripts to track changes.
8. **Utilize mocks and stubs** to isolate components during testing.
9. **Document test cases and strategies** for team knowledge sharing.
10. **Regularly review test results** to identify trends and areas for improvement.

### Code Standards
- Follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern for structuring tests.
- Use `assert` statements to validate expected outcomes clearly.
- Avoid hard-coded values; use configuration files for test data.
- Implement error handling in tests to manage unexpected scenarios.

### Tool Configuration
- Configure **Selenium WebDriver** with appropriate wait strategies to handle dynamic content.
- Set up **Jenkins** pipelines with stages for build, test, and deployment.
- Use **Playwright** for parallel test execution across multiple browsers.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Self-Healing Tests
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when UI elements frequently change, causing test failures.

**Implementation Details**: 
1. Integrate AI tools like Testim to analyze test failures.
2. Configure the tool to automatically update locators based on changes.
3. Regularly review self-healing logs to ensure accuracy.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// Example of a self-healing test using Testim
const { test } = require('testim');

test('Self-healing test example', async t => {
    await t.navigateTo('https://example.com');
    await t.click('#dynamicButton'); // Locator adapts to changes
    await t.expect('#result').contains('Success');
});
```

### Pattern Name: Dynamic Test Selection
**When to Apply**: Implement this when you want to optimize test execution based on recent code changes.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline to trigger tests based on commit messages.
2. Use tags to categorize tests by functionality.
3. Execute only relevant tests based on the modified code areas.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
# Example Jenkins pipeline snippet for dynamic test selection
pipeline {
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def changedFiles = sh(script: 'git diff --name-only HEAD~1', returnStdout: true).trim()
                    if (changedFiles.contains('src/featureA')) {
                        sh 'npm run test:featureA'
                    } else {
                        sh 'npm run test:all'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Test Data Management
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when managing test data across multiple environments.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create scripts to generate synthetic data for testing.
2. Implement cleanup routines to reset data states post-testing.
3. Use environment variables to switch between test data sets.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// Example of generating test data
const generateTestData = () => {
    return {
        username: `testUser_${Date.now()}`,
        email: `test@example.com`
    };
};

// Cleanup function
const cleanupTestData = async () => {
    await db.collection('users').deleteMany({ email: 'test@example.com' });
};
```

### Advanced Technique: Security Testing Integration
Integrate security testing tools like SAST and DAST into your CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.

### Advanced Technique: Contract Testing
Utilize contract testing to ensure that services communicate correctly, especially in microservices architectures. This validates API contracts between services before deployment.

### Advanced Technique: Property-Based Testing
Apply property-based testing to generate a wide range of input data automatically, ensuring that your code behaves correctly under various conditions.

### Advanced Technique: Test-Driven Refactoring
Use test-driven refactoring to improve code quality while ensuring that existing functionality remains intact. This involves writing tests for new features before refactoring existing code.
