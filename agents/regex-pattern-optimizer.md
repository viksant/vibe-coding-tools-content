## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful for string matching and manipulation, but they can become slow if not designed carefully. Understanding different regex engines is key, as they have unique performance traits and limitations. For example, `RE2` avoids catastrophic backtracking, making it ideal for performance-sensitive applications.

Handling Unicode adds another layer of complexity. You must construct regex patterns with an understanding of character classes and properties to ensure they work correctly across languages and scripts. This often includes using Unicode property escapes and recognizing how different engines interpret these properties.

Maintainability is also crucial. Regex patterns should be as simple as possible while still meeting their requirements. Breaking complex patterns into smaller, reusable parts and adding comments can help explain tricky sections.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Catastrophic Backtracking**: Ignoring patterns that could lead to excessive backtracking, which slows down performance.
- **Overly Complex Patterns**: Creating complicated regex that are hard to read and maintain.
- **Ignoring Unicode**: Not considering Unicode characters, which can result in incorrect matches.
- **Neglecting Performance Testing**: Failing to benchmark regex patterns against large datasets to spot performance issues.
- **Using Non-Atomic Grouping**: Not using atomic groups when they are needed, leading to inefficient backtracking.
- **Misunderstanding Engine Differences**: Assuming all regex engines behave the same, which can lead to unexpected results.
- **Lack of Validation**: Not validating regex patterns for safety, which can create security vulnerabilities.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Use Non-Capturing Groups**: When you don't need capturing groups, use `(?:...)` to boost performance.
- **Prefer `\d`, `\w`, and `\s`**: These shorthand character classes improve readability and performance.
- **Limit Quantifiers**: Avoid greedy quantifiers (`.*`) when possible; opt for lazy quantifiers (`.*?`) or specific quantifiers to cut down on backtracking.
- **Benchmark Patterns**: Regularly test regex patterns against large datasets to find performance bottlenecks.
- **Utilize Atomic Groups**: Use atomic groups to prevent backtracking in complex patterns.
- **Comment Your Regex**: Add comments to clarify complex regex sections for better maintainability.
- **Test with Real Data**: Validate regex patterns using realistic data to ensure they perform well.
- **Use Tools for Optimization**: Leverage tools like `regex101` and `regexr` to visualize and enhance regex patterns.
- **Avoid Lookaheads and Lookbehinds**: Use these sparingly since they can complicate patterns and affect performance.
- **Regularly Review Patterns**: Conduct code reviews focused on regex patterns to ensure adherence to best practices.

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Track how long regex patterns take to execute with typical input sizes.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory use during regex operations to identify inefficiencies.
- **Backtracking Count**: Keep an eye on the number of backtracking events to evaluate regex performance.
- **Match Success Rate**: Measure the percentage of successful matches against expected results.
- **Complexity Score**: Use complexity metrics to gauge the maintainability of regex patterns.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Test Patterns**: Use tools like `regex101` to validate regex patterns.
2. **Avoid Catastrophic Backtracking**: Create patterns that minimize backtracking through specific quantifiers and non-greedy matching.
3. **Use Anchors**: Leverage `^` and `$` to match the start and end of strings, reducing unnecessary checks.
4. **Limit Grouping**: Use capturing groups only when absolutely necessary; prefer non-capturing groups for better performance.
5. **Optimize Character Classes**: Use character classes to narrow the scope of matches effectively.
6. **Benchmark Regularly**: Regularly test regex patterns against large datasets to find performance issues.
7. **Comment Complex Patterns**: Document complex regex patterns to enhance readability and maintainability.
8. **Use Unicode Properties**: Apply Unicode properties for internationalization support in regex patterns.
9. **Avoid Nested Quantifiers**: Steer clear of nested quantifiers as they can lead to performance issues.
10. **Use Atomic Groups**: Implement atomic groups to avoid backtracking in intricate patterns.
11. **Validate Input**: Always check user input against regex patterns to prevent injection attacks.
12. **Review Patterns Periodically**: Regularly assess regex patterns to ensure they follow best practices.
13. **Educate Team Members**: Share your knowledge on regex best practices with your team to improve overall code quality.
14. **Utilize Performance Profiling**: Use profiling tools to analyze regex performance in production settings.
15. **Keep Patterns Simple**: Aim for simplicity in regex patterns to enhance maintainability and readability.

### Code Standards
- **Pattern Example**: 
  ```regex
  ^(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*)?$
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This pattern matches a name that starts with a capital letter, which can have multiple parts, each starting with a capital letter to ensure proper formatting.

- **Anti-Pattern Example**:
  ```regex
  (.*)+
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This can cause catastrophic backtracking due to nested quantifiers. Itâ€™s better to replace it with a more specific pattern.

### Tool Configuration
- **`regex101` Settings**: 
  - Turn on "Global" and "Multiline" flags for thorough testing.
  - Use "Debug" mode to visualize the matching process and spot backtracking issues.

- **`re2` Configuration**: 
  - Compile patterns with the `RE2::Options` to prevent backtracking.
  - Use `RE2::Set` for efficiently matching multiple patterns.

  ```
  - **Explanation**: This pattern matches both HTTP and HTTPS URLs, capturing optional ports and paths.

### Pattern Name: Phone Number Formatting
- **When to Apply**: Use when validating and formatting phone numbers.

  ```
  - **Explanation**: This pattern matches 10-digit phone numbers with optional international codes.

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Evaluate execution time and memory usage.
- **Correctness**: Ensure the regex matches all expected cases without false positives.
- **Maintainability**: Consider the readability and simplicity of the regex pattern.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Complexity vs. Performance**: More complex patterns can be harder to maintain but might offer better performance in specific situations.
- **Flexibility vs. Specificity**: A more flexible regex may match unintended inputs, while a specific regex might miss valid cases.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use `PCRE` vs. `RE2`**:
  - Go with `PCRE` for complex patterns needing lookaheads or lookbehinds.
  - Choose `RE2` for performance-critical applications where backtracking needs to be avoided.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
