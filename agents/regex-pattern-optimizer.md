## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for string matching and manipulation, but they can become inefficient if not crafted carefully. A deep understanding of regex engines is crucial, as different engines (like `PCRE` and `RE2`) have distinct performance characteristics and limitations. For instance, `RE2` is designed to avoid catastrophic backtracking, making it suitable for applications where performance is critical. 

Unicode handling is another complex area; regex patterns must be constructed with awareness of character classes and properties to ensure they function correctly across different languages and scripts. This involves using Unicode property escapes and understanding how different regex engines interpret these properties.

Furthermore, maintainability is vital in regex design. Patterns should be as simple as possible while still meeting requirements. This often involves breaking complex patterns into smaller, reusable components and using comments to explain non-obvious parts of the regex.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Catastrophic Backtracking**: Failing to recognize patterns that can lead to excessive backtracking, causing performance degradation.
- **Overly Complex Patterns**: Creating regex that is too complicated, making it difficult to read and maintain.
- **Ignoring Unicode**: Not accounting for Unicode characters, leading to incorrect matches in international applications.
- **Neglecting Performance Testing**: Failing to benchmark regex patterns against large datasets to identify performance issues.
- **Using Non-Atomic Grouping**: Not utilizing atomic groups when necessary, which can lead to inefficient backtracking.
- **Misunderstanding Engine Differences**: Assuming all regex engines behave the same, leading to unexpected results.
- **Lack of Validation**: Not validating regex patterns for safety, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Use Non-Capturing Groups**: When capturing groups are not needed, use `(?:...)` to improve performance.
- **Prefer `\d`, `\w`, and `\s`**: Use shorthand character classes for better readability and performance.
- **Limit Quantifiers**: Avoid using greedy quantifiers (`.*`) when possible; prefer lazy quantifiers (`.*?`) or specific quantifiers to reduce backtracking.
- **Benchmark Patterns**: Regularly test regex patterns against large datasets to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Utilize Atomic Groups**: Use atomic groups to prevent backtracking in complex patterns.
- **Comment Your Regex**: Use comments to explain complex parts of your regex for future maintainability.
- **Test with Real Data**: Validate regex patterns with realistic data to ensure they perform as expected.
- **Use Tools for Optimization**: Leverage tools like `regex101` and `regexr` to visualize and optimize regex patterns.
- **Avoid Lookaheads and Lookbehinds**: Use these constructs sparingly, as they can complicate patterns and impact performance.
- **Regularly Review Patterns**: Conduct code reviews specifically for regex patterns to ensure they adhere to best practices.

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Measure the time taken to execute regex patterns against typical input sizes.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during regex operations to identify potential inefficiencies.
- **Backtracking Count**: Analyze the number of backtracking events to assess regex performance.
- **Match Success Rate**: Evaluate the percentage of successful matches against expected results.
- **Complexity Score**: Use complexity metrics to assess the maintainability of regex patterns.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Test Patterns**: Validate regex patterns using tools like `regex101` to ensure they work as intended.
2. **Avoid Catastrophic Backtracking**: Design patterns to minimize backtracking by using specific quantifiers and non-greedy matching.
3. **Use Anchors**: Utilize `^` and `$` to match the start and end of strings, reducing unnecessary checks.
4. **Limit Grouping**: Use capturing groups only when necessary; prefer non-capturing groups to improve performance.
5. **Optimize Character Classes**: Use character classes effectively to limit the scope of matches.
6. **Benchmark Regularly**: Regularly benchmark regex patterns against large datasets to identify performance issues.
7. **Comment Complex Patterns**: Document complex regex patterns to improve readability and maintainability.
8. **Use Unicode Properties**: Leverage Unicode properties for internationalization support in regex patterns.
9. **Avoid Nested Quantifiers**: Refrain from using nested quantifiers, as they can lead to performance issues.
10. **Use Atomic Groups**: Implement atomic groups to prevent backtracking in complex patterns.
11. **Validate Input**: Always validate user input against regex patterns to prevent injection attacks.
12. **Review Patterns Periodically**: Conduct regular reviews of regex patterns to ensure they adhere to best practices.
13. **Educate Team Members**: Share knowledge about regex best practices with team members to improve overall code quality.
14. **Utilize Performance Profiling**: Use profiling tools to analyze regex performance in production environments.
15. **Keep Patterns Simple**: Strive for simplicity in regex patterns to enhance maintainability and readability.

### Code Standards
- **Pattern Example**: 
  ```regex
  ^(?:[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*)?$
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This pattern matches a name that starts with a capital letter and can have multiple parts, each starting with a capital letter, ensuring proper formatting.

- **Anti-Pattern Example**:
  ```regex
  (.*)+
  ```
  - **Explanation**: This pattern can lead to catastrophic backtracking due to the nested quantifiers. Replace with a more specific pattern.

### Tool Configuration
- **`regex101` Settings**: 
  - Enable "Global" and "Multiline" flags for comprehensive testing.
  - Use "Debug" mode to visualize the matching process and identify backtracking issues.

- **`re2` Configuration**: 
  - Ensure patterns are compiled with the `RE2::Options` to avoid backtracking.
  - Use `RE2::Set` for matching multiple patterns efficiently.
