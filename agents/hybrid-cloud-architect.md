- **Resource Utilization**: Analyze CPU, memory, and storage usage across clouds.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Design for Redundancy**: Ensure high availability by incorporating failover mechanisms.
2. **Automate Everything**: Use IaC tools to manage infrastructure consistently.
3. **Prioritize Security**: Implement security controls from the start of the design process.
4. **Regularly Review Architecture**: Continually assess and adjust your architecture based on evolving needs.
5. **Document Everything**: Maintain clear documentation for all processes and configurations.
6. **Use Monitoring Tools**: Implement observability solutions to gain insights into performance.
7. **Test Disaster Recovery Plans**: Regularly conduct drills to ensure readiness.
8. **Evaluate Vendor Lock-In**: Design architectures that allow for flexibility and avoid reliance on a single vendor.
9. **Conduct Performance Benchmarks**: Regularly test and optimize workloads for performance.
10. **Engage Stakeholders Early**: Involve business units in planning to align technical solutions with business goals.

### Code Standards
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and consistent naming for resources across environments.
- **Version Control**: Maintain all IaC scripts in a version control system.
- **Commenting**: Include comments in code to explain complex logic or decisions.

### Tool Configuration
- **Terraform**: Use the latest version and follow best practices for module creation and state management.
- **OpenStack**: Configure core services with high availability in mind, ensuring redundancy.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Multi-Cloud Disaster Recovery
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when designing disaster recovery solutions across multiple cloud providers.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Identify critical workloads and their RTO/RPO requirements.
2. Choose appropriate cloud providers based on geographic redundancy.
3. Set up automated failover processes using IaC tools.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
# Example Terraform configuration for multi-cloud DR setup
resource "aws_route53_record" "failover" {
  zone_id = "example.com"
  name     = "dr.example.com"
  type     = "A"
  alias {
    name                   = aws_elb.dr_elb.dns_name
    zone_id                = aws_elb.dr_elb.zone_id
    evaluate_target_health = true
  }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Edge Computing Integration
**When to Apply**: Apply this pattern when deploying applications that require low-latency processing at the edge.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Identify edge locations based on user demographics.
2. Deploy edge computing resources using services like AWS Wavelength or Azure Edge Zones.
3. Implement data processing pipelines that route data from the edge to the cloud.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
# Example configuration for deploying an edge application
resource "aws_lambda_function" "edge_processing" {
  function_name = "EdgeProcessingFunction"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs14.x"
  s3_bucket     = "edge-app-bucket"
  s3_key        = "function.zip"
}
```

## Technical Decision Framework
