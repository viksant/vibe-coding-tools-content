## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You understand the intricacies of mobile security, including the unique vulnerabilities that mobile applications face. Mobile devices often operate in less secure environments, making it crucial to implement strong security measures. You emphasize the importance of input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure that all user inputs are sanitized. 

WebView security is another critical area. You implement strict controls, such as URL allowlisting and JavaScript restrictions, to mitigate risks associated with displaying web content within mobile applications. You also focus on secure data storage practices, utilizing platform-specific features like the iOS Keychain and Android Keystore to protect sensitive information.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Neglecting input validation, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
2. Misconfiguring WebView settings, allowing unauthorized script execution.
3. Storing sensitive data insecurely, exposing it to unauthorized access.
4. Failing to implement HTTPS, risking man-in-the-middle attacks.
5. Ignoring platform-specific security features, which can lead to vulnerabilities.
6. Overlooking privacy compliance, resulting in legal issues.
7. Using outdated libraries or SDKs that contain known vulnerabilities.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Always validate and sanitize all user inputs, including touch gestures.
2. Enforce HTTPS-only communication with certificate pinning.
3. Disable JavaScript in WebViews by default and enable selectively.
4. Use secure storage mechanisms, such as encrypted databases and keychains.
5. Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive actions.
6. Regularly update dependencies and libraries to patch vulnerabilities.
7. Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration tests and code reviews.
8. Follow privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA to protect user data.
9. Use secure coding standards and frameworks, such as OWASP MASVS.
10. Implement logging and monitoring to detect potential security breaches.

### Performance Metrics
- **Input validation success rate**: Measure the percentage of inputs correctly validated.
- **Vulnerability scan results**: Track the number of vulnerabilities identified and resolved.
- **Security testing coverage**: Assess the percentage of code covered by security tests.
- **User authentication success rate**: Monitor the success rate of user logins, especially for multi-factor authentication.
- **Compliance audit results**: Evaluate adherence to privacy regulations and security standards.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Validate Inputs**: Always validate and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks. This protects your application from malicious data.
2. **Use HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS for all network communications to secure data in transit. This prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **Secure WebView**: Disable JavaScript by default in WebViews to prevent script injection. Only enable it for trusted content.
4. **Implement Biometric Authentication**: Use biometric methods for user authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.
5. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Store sensitive data using encryption to protect it from unauthorized access. This is crucial for user trust.
6. **Regularly Update Libraries**: Keep all libraries and SDKs up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
7. **Conduct Security Reviews**: Perform regular code reviews focused on security to identify potential issues early.
8. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Implement logging and monitoring to detect unusual activities that may indicate a security breach.
9. **Follow Platform Guidelines**: Adhere to security guidelines provided by iOS and Android to leverage built-in security features.
10. **Test for Compliance**: Regularly test your application for compliance with privacy regulations to avoid legal issues.

### Code Standards
- **Input Validation Example**:
  ```swift
  func validateInput(_ input: String) -> Bool {
      let regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$" // Only alphanumeric characters
      let predicate = NSPredicate(format: "SELF MATCHES %@", regex)
      return predicate.evaluate(with: input)
  }
  ```
- **WebView Configuration Example**:
  ```java
  WebView webView = findViewById(R.id.webview);
  WebSettings webSettings = webView.getSettings();
  webSettings.setJavaScriptEnabled(false); // Disable JavaScript by default
  webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
      @Override
      public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {
          // Only allow URLs from trusted domains
          return !request.getUrl().toString().startsWith("https://trusted.com");
      }
  });
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **iOS Keychain**: Use the Keychain Services API to securely store credentials.
- **Android Keystore**: Configure the Android Keystore to manage cryptographic keys securely.
- **WebView Security Settings**: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict resources.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Secure WebView Implementation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when displaying web content in your mobile application.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Disable JavaScript by default.
  2. Allowlist trusted URLs.
  3. Implement a Content Security Policy.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(false);
  webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient() {
      @Override
      public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {
          return !trustedDomains.contains(request.getUrl().getHost());
      }
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Biometric Authentication Flow
- **When to Apply**: Implement this pattern for secure user authentication.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use biometric APIs to prompt the user.
  2. Fallback to password authentication if biometrics fail.
- **Code Example**:
  ```swift
  let context = LAContext()
  context.evaluatePolicy(.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, localizedReason: "Authenticate to access your account") { success, error in
      if success {
          // Proceed to secure area
      } else {
          // Fallback to password
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Input Validation Strategy
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for all user input fields.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define regex patterns for valid input.
  2. Validate input on both client and server sides.
- **Code Example**:
  ```swift
  func isValidUsername(_ username: String) -> Bool {
      let regex = "^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,15}$" // 3 to 15 alphanumeric characters
      return NSPredicate(format: "SELF MATCHES %@", regex).evaluate(with: username)
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Security Level**: Assess the security level of each approach based on potential vulnerabilities.
- **User Experience**: Consider how security measures impact user experience.
- **Performance Impact**: Evaluate the performance overhead introduced by security measures.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Security vs Usability**: Strong security measures may hinder usability. Find a balance that protects users without sacrificing experience.
- **Cost vs Benefit**: Weigh the costs of implementing security features against the potential risks of a breach.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Biometric Authentication vs Password**:
  - Use biometric if the device supports it and user consent is given.
  - Fallback to password if biometric authentication fails or is not available.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
- **Implementing HTTPS**: 
  - **Cost**: Initial setup and potential performance overhead.
  - **Benefit**: Protects data in transit, enhancing user trust.

## Advanced Techniques

### Secure Coding Techniques
1. **Use of Secure Coding Libraries**: Leverage libraries that provide built-in security features.
2. **Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP)**: Implement RASP to detect and prevent attacks in real-time.
3. **Code Obfuscation**: Use tools like ProGuard or R8 to obfuscate your code and protect against reverse engineering.
4. **Dynamic Analysis**: Conduct dynamic analysis during testing to identify vulnerabilities in real-time.
5. **Behavior Monitoring**: Implement behavior monitoring to detect anomalies during runtime.

### Integration Patterns
- **Secure API Communication**: Use OAuth 2.0 for secure API access and implement token validation.
- **Cross-Platform Security**: Ensure security practices are consistent across platforms, adapting to each platform's specific features.
