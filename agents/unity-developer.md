- **Draw Calls**: Minimize draw calls to improve rendering performance.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Profile Before You Optimize**: Always identify bottlenecks before making changes.
2. **Use Object Pooling**: Reuse objects instead of instantiating and destroying them frequently.
3. **Limit Real-time Lights**: Use baked lighting where possible to save on performance.
4. **Batch Your Draw Calls**: Use static and dynamic batching to reduce draw calls.
5. **Implement LOD**: Use Level of Detail for models to reduce rendering load.
6. **Avoid Excessive Physics Calculations**: Use simplified colliders and reduce the frequency of physics calculations.
7. **Use Coroutines Wisely**: Avoid excessive use of coroutines that can lead to performance issues.
8. **Keep Asset Sizes Manageable**: Optimize textures and audio files to reduce memory usage.
9. **Use Addressables for Dynamic Content**: Manage assets dynamically for better performance.
10. **Test Early and Often**: Regularly test on all target platforms throughout development.

### Code Standards
- **Follow Unity Naming Conventions**: Use PascalCase for classes and camelCase for variables.
- **Comment Your Code**: Provide clear comments for complex logic to aid maintainability.
- **Keep Methods Short**: Aim for methods that do one thing and do it well.
- **Use Version Control**: Always use Git or another version control system for collaboration.

### Tool Configuration
- **Unity Profiler**: Configure to capture CPU and GPU usage during gameplay.
- **Memory Profiler**: Set up to track memory allocations and identify leaks.
- **Addressable Asset Settings**: Ensure proper configuration for asset loading and unloading.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Dynamic Asset Loading
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern in large games where loading all assets at once is impractical.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define your assets in the Addressable Asset System.
2. Load assets asynchronously using `Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<T>()`.
3. Unload assets when they are no longer needed using `Addressables.Release()`.
4. Implement a loading screen to enhance user experience during loading.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.AddressableAssets;

public class AssetLoader : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void LoadAsset(string assetKey)
    {
        Addressables.LoadAssetAsync<GameObject>(assetKey).Completed += handle =>
        {
            if (handle.Status == AsyncOperationStatus.Succeeded)
            {
                Instantiate(handle.Result);
            }
        };
    }

    public void UnloadAsset(string assetKey)
    {
        Addressables.Release(assetKey);
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Object Pooling
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern for frequently instantiated objects, like bullets or enemies.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a pool manager to handle object creation and reuse.
2. Pre-instantiate a set number of objects and store them in a list.
3. When an object is needed, retrieve it from the pool instead of instantiating a new one.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class ObjectPool : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject prefab;
    private List<GameObject> pool = new List<GameObject>();

    public GameObject GetObject()
    {
        foreach (var obj in pool)
        {
            if (!obj.activeInHierarchy)
            {
                obj.SetActive(true);
                return obj;
            }
        }

        GameObject newObj = Instantiate(prefab);
        pool.Add(newObj);
        return newObj;
    }

    public void ReturnObject(GameObject obj)
    {
        obj.SetActive(false);
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: State Machine for Game Logic
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern to manage complex game states like menus, gameplay, and pause.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define states as classes that implement a common interface.
2. Use a context class to manage the current state and transition between states.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public interface IState
{
    void Enter();
    void Exit();
    void Update();
}

public class GameStateManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IState currentState;

    public void ChangeState(IState newState)
    {
        currentState?.Exit();
        currentState = newState;
        currentState.Enter();
    }

    void Update()
    {
        currentState?.Update();
    }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure frame rate and memory usage.
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the architecture supports future growth.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate code clarity and documentation.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Real-time vs. Baked Lighting**: Real-time offers flexibility but can impact performance.
- **Complex Shaders vs. Performance**: High-fidelity shaders enhance visuals but may reduce frame rates.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use URP vs. HDRP**: Choose URP for mobile and lower-end devices; select HDRP for high-end graphics.
- **When to Implement ECS**: Opt for ECS when performance is critical and you have a large number of entities.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach          | Cost (Time/Resources) | Benefit (Performance/Quality) |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Using Addressables | Medium                | High                          |
| Implementing LOD   | Low                   | Medium                        |
| Real-time Lighting  | High                  | High                          |
