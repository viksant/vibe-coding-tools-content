2. Use **SAST and DAST** tools in CI/CD pipelines for automated security checks.
3. Conduct regular **security training** for development teams.
4. Maintain an updated inventory of third-party libraries and their vulnerabilities.
5. Establish a **zero-trust architecture** to enhance access controls.
6. Automate compliance checks using **Policy as Code**.
7. Regularly review and update incident response plans.
8. Utilize **multi-factor authentication** for all critical systems.
9. Monitor security metrics and KPIs to assess the effectiveness of security measures.
10. Engage in **red team exercises** to simulate attacks and improve defenses.

### Performance Metrics

- **Incident response time**: Track the time taken to respond to and resolve security incidents.
- **Security training completion rates**: Monitor the percentage of team members completing security training.
- **Number of security incidents**: Analyze trends in security incidents over time.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Integrate security into CI/CD**: Ensure security checks are part of the build process to catch issues early.
2. **Conduct regular security audits**: Schedule audits to assess compliance and security posture.
3. **Automate vulnerability scanning**: Use tools to automate the detection of vulnerabilities in code and dependencies.
4. **Implement least privilege access**: Limit user permissions to only what is necessary for their role.
5. **Utilize secure coding standards**: Follow language-specific guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities.
6. **Regularly update dependencies**: Keep third-party libraries up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
7. **Document security policies**: Maintain clear and accessible documentation of security practices and procedures.
8. **Engage in threat modeling**: Regularly assess potential threats to applications and infrastructure.
9. **Monitor for anomalies**: Use security monitoring tools to detect unusual behavior in systems.
10. **Plan for incident response**: Develop and regularly test incident response plans.

### Code Standards
- **Use parameterized queries**: Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements.
- **Implement input validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized.
- **Employ security headers**: Use headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options to enhance security.
- **Handle errors securely**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
- **Use HTTPS**: Ensure all communications are encrypted in transit.

### Tool Configuration
- **Configure OAuth2**: Set up proper scopes and token lifetimes to enhance security.
- **Set up HashiCorp Vault**: Use it for secrets management and encryption key storage.
- **Implement Kubernetes security policies**: Enforce network policies and role-based access controls.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Secure API Development
**When to Apply**: When developing APIs that handle sensitive data.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Use OAuth2 for authentication and authorization.
2. Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
3. Implement rate limiting to protect against abuse.
4. Log all access attempts for auditing purposes.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
const app = express();

// Rate limiting middleware
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
});
app.use(limiter);

// Input validation example
app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  const { data } = req.body;
  if (!data || typeof data !== 'string') {
    return res.status(400).send('Invalid input');
  }
  // Process data...
});
```

### Pattern Name: Incident Response Planning
**When to Apply**: When establishing a security posture for an organization.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define roles and responsibilities for the incident response team.
2. Develop playbooks for common incident types.
3. Conduct regular training and simulation exercises.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
incident_response_plan:
  roles:
    - name: Incident Commander
      responsibilities: "Oversee incident response efforts"
    - name: Security Analyst
      responsibilities: "Analyze and contain the incident"
  playbooks:
    - name: Data Breach
      steps:
        - "Identify the breach source"
        - "Contain the breach"
        - "Notify affected parties"
```

### Pattern Name: Cloud Security Best Practices
**When to Apply**: When deploying applications in cloud environments.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Use IAM roles to manage permissions.
2. Enable logging and monitoring for all cloud resources.
3. Regularly review security group settings.

**Code Example**:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
