## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Optimizing Core Web Vitals requires knowing how different web technologies interact. For example, **LCP** measures loading performance, which depends on server response times, resource load times, and client-side rendering. Techniques like preloading key resources and optimizing images can greatly improve LCP scores.

**FID** measures interactivity. You can enhance it by reducing JavaScript execution time and steering clear of long tasks that block the main thread. Using tools like Web Workers helps keep the main thread responsive.

**CLS** measures visual stability. To prevent layout shifts, make sure to reserve space for images and ads. Using CSS aspect ratio boxes and setting dimensions for media elements effectively reduces CLS.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Ignoring server response times, which can hurt LCP.
2. Not optimizing images, leading to large file sizes.
3. Neglecting caching strategies for static assets.
4. Overloading on third-party scripts that block rendering.
5. Skipping performance tests on real devices and networks.
6. Misconfiguring lazy loading, causing content not to load as expected.
7. Underestimating how CSS and JavaScript affect rendering times.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **next/image** in Next.js for automatic image optimization.
2. Implement **code splitting** to load only essential JavaScript for the initial render.
3. Utilize **HTTP/2** for faster requests and reduced load times.
4. Apply **preconnect** and **dns-prefetch** for third-party resources.
5. Set appropriate **cache-control** headers for static assets.
6. Optimize fonts with `font-display: swap` to avoid blocking rendering.
7. Regularly audit performance using Lighthouse and WebPageTest.
8. Monitor real user metrics (RUM) for insights on actual user experiences.
9. Use **service workers** for effective caching.
10. Design with mobile-first principles to boost performance on mobile devices.

### Performance Metrics
- **LCP**: Aim for under 2.5 seconds.
- **FID**: Target under 100 milliseconds.
- **CLS**: Keep below 0.1.
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: Less than 300 milliseconds.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Target under 0.1.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Under 1.8 seconds.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Minimize JavaScript**: Cut down on JavaScript loaded on the initial page to improve FID.
   - **Why**: Less JavaScript leads to faster parsing and execution, which speeds up interactivity.

2. **Optimize Images**: Serve images in next-gen formats (like WebP) and ensure they are properly sized.
   - **Why**: Smaller images reduce load times and enhance LCP.

3. **Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Distribute static assets via a CDN to lower latency.
   - **Why**: CDNs cache content closer to users, speeding up load times.

4. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Delay loading offscreen images and iframes until they’re needed.
   - **Why**: This reduces initial load time and boosts LCP.

5. **Preload Key Resources**: Use `<link rel="preload">` for critical resources like fonts and images.
   - **Why**: Preloading helps the browser prioritize important resources, enhancing performance.

6. **Avoid Layout Thrashing**: Minimize quick succession DOM reads and writes.
   - **Why**: This prevents unnecessary reflows and repaints, which improves CLS.

7. **Use Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: For frameworks like Next.js, leverage SSR for quicker initial loads.
   - **Why**: SSR can reduce LCP by sending fully rendered pages to the client.

8. **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Use tools like Google Lighthouse and WebPageTest frequently.
   - **Why**: Regular audits help catch performance issues early.

9. **Limit Third-Party Scripts**: Include only essential scripts and load them asynchronously.
   - **Why**: Fewer scripts improve loading performance.

10. **Set Proper Cache Headers**: Ensure static assets are cached correctly to speed up load times for returning visitors.
    - **Why**: Proper caching can greatly enhance repeat visit performance.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Loading all JavaScript in the `<head>` without async or defer attributes.
  - **Example**: 
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```
  - **Correct Approach**: 
    ```html
    <script src="script.js" async></script>
    ```

- **Best Practice**: Use CSS to prevent layout shifts.
  - **Example**:
    ```css
    img {
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
    }
    ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Next.js**: Ensure `next.config.js` is set up for performance:
  ```javascript
  module.exports = {
    images: {
      domains: ['example.com'],
      deviceSizes: [320, 420, 768, 1024, 1200],
      imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96],
    },
    future: {
      webpack5: true,
    },
  };
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Lazy Loading Images
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for pages with multiple images, like galleries or product listings.
- **Implementation Details**: Add the `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags.
- **Code Example**:
  ```html
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" loading="lazy" />
  ```

### Pattern Name: Code Splitting with Dynamic Imports
- **When to Apply**: Use this when building large applications where some components aren’t needed on the initial load.
- **Implementation Details**: Use React's `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

  function App() {
    return (
      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </React.Suspense>
    );
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Preloading Key Fonts
- **When to Apply**: Use this when custom fonts are crucial for the initial render.
- **Implementation Details**: Add `<link rel="preload">` in the `<head>`.
- **Code Example**:
  ```html
  <link rel="preload" href="/fonts/myfont.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous">
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance Impact**: Measure the effect on LCP, FID, and CLS.
- **Development Complexity**: Look at the effort needed to implement changes.
- **User Experience**: Think about how changes affect the user experience.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **SSR vs. SSG**: SSR works better for dynamic content, while SSG is faster for static sites.
- **Image Quality vs. Load Time**: Higher quality images look better but can slow load times.

### Decision Trees
- **Choosing Between SSR and SSG**:
  - If the content updates often, go with **SSR**.
  - If the content is static, opt for **SSG**.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach          | Cost (Development Time) | Benefit (Performance Improvement) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Lazy Loading       | Low                     | High                              |
| Code Splitting     | Medium                  | High                              |
| Image Optimization  | Low                     | Medium                            |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Critical CSS**: Extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content to boost FCP.
2. **Service Workers**: Use service workers for caching strategies that improve performance and offline capabilities.
3. **HTTP/2 Server Push**: Implement HTTP/2 server push to send resources to the client before they request them.
4. **Resource Hints**: Use resource hints like `preconnect` and `dns-prefetch` to optimize loading of third-party resources.
5. **WebP Images**: Serve images in WebP format for better compression and faster loading.
6. **Performance Budgets**: Set performance budgets to keep track of resource sizes and load times.
7. **Monitoring Tools**: Use tools like Google Analytics and Lighthouse CI for ongoing performance monitoring.
