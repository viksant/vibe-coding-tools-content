### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing async without understanding its impact on performance.
2. Neglecting proper error handling in async functions.
3. Failing to validate data inputs, leading to runtime errors.
4. Ignoring performance profiling, which can hide bottlenecks.
5. Skipping tests for edge cases, resulting in fragile applications.
6. Misconfiguring dependency management tools, causing version conflicts.
7. Underestimating the importance of documentation for maintainability.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use type hints consistently to improve code readability.
2. Implement comprehensive testing with high coverage.
3. Profile applications regularly to identify performance bottlenecks.
4. Utilize async programming for I/O-bound tasks.
5. Validate all data inputs using Pydantic models.
6. Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code style.
7. Leverage Docker for consistent development and production environments.
8. Use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality checks.
9. Document code thoroughly with docstrings and examples.
10. Stay updated with the latest Python releases and ecosystem changes.

### Performance Metrics
- Measure response times for APIs using tools like `pytest-benchmark`.
- Track memory usage with `memory_profiler`.
- Analyze code coverage with `pytest-cov`.
- Monitor application performance with APM tools.
- Evaluate async performance using `asyncio` event loop metrics.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always validate inputs**: Use Pydantic models to ensure data integrity.
2. **Profile before optimizing**: Identify bottlenecks using profiling tools.
3. **Write tests for every feature**: Aim for over 90% code coverage.
4. **Use async for I/O-bound tasks**: This improves responsiveness.
5. **Document your code**: Use docstrings for functions and classes.
6. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly review and update your `pyproject.toml`.
7. **Use environment variables for configuration**: This enhances security.
8. **Implement error handling**: Use try-except blocks to manage exceptions.
9. **Leverage caching**: Use `functools.lru_cache` for expensive function calls.
10. **Containerize applications**: Use Docker for consistent environments.
11. **Automate testing with CI/CD**: Integrate GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
12. **Monitor application performance**: Use logging and APM tools.
13. **Follow SOLID principles**: This promotes maintainable code.
14. **Use type hints throughout**: This improves code clarity and reduces bugs.
15. **Avoid global state**: This minimizes side effects and enhances testability.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Using global variables for state management.
- **Pattern**: Use dependency injection for better modularity.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  class Database:
      def __init__(self, connection_string):
          self.connection_string = connection_string

  def get_database_instance(connection_string):
      return Database(connection_string)
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Configure `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for linting and formatting.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
      rev: v3.4.0
      hooks:
        - id: trailing-whitespace
        - id: end-of-file-fixer
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Async API Handler
**When to Apply**: Use when building high-performance APIs that require non-blocking I/O.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define an async function for the API endpoint.
2. Use Pydantic for request validation.
3. Implement error handling with appropriate HTTP responses.

**Code Example**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float

@app.post("/items/")
async def create_item(item: Item):
    if item.price < 0:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Price must be positive")
    return item
```

### Pattern Name: Caching with LRU
**When to Apply**: Use when dealing with expensive function calls that can benefit from caching.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Decorate the function with `@lru_cache`.
2. Ensure the function arguments are hashable.

**Code Example**:
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=100)
def expensive_computation(x):
    # Simulate a time-consuming computation
    return x * x
```

### Pattern Name: Dockerizing a FastAPI App
**When to Apply**: Use when deploying a FastAPI application to ensure consistency across environments.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a `Dockerfile`.
2. Use multi-stage builds for smaller images.

**Code Example**:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- Performance: Response times and resource usage.
- Maintainability: Code readability and documentation.
- Scalability: Ability to handle increased load.
- Security: Vulnerability assessments and best practices.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Async vs. Threading**: Async is better for I/O-bound tasks, while threading can be beneficial for CPU-bound tasks.
- **Complexity vs. Performance**: More complex solutions may yield better performance but can be harder to maintain.

### Decision Trees
- **When to use FastAPI vs. Django**:
  - FastAPI for microservices and high-performance APIs.
  - Django for full-featured web applications with built-in ORM.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach         | Cost | Benefit             |
|------------------|------|---------------------|
| Async Programming | Medium | Improved performance for I/O-bound tasks |
| Dockerization     | Low   | Consistent environments across development and production |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Using AsyncIO for Concurrency**: Implement async functions to handle multiple I/O-bound tasks simultaneously.
2. **Custom Decorators for Caching**: Create decorators that cache results based on function arguments.
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use message brokers like RabbitMQ or Kafka for decoupled services.
4. **Functional Programming Techniques**: Leverage higher-order functions and immutability for cleaner code.
5. **Metaprogramming**: Use metaclasses to create classes dynamically based on runtime conditions.
6. **Advanced Logging**: Implement structured logging for better observability.
7. **Data Pipeline Optimization**: Use Dask for parallel computing on large datasets.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Slow API Response** → Inefficient database queries → Optimize queries and add indexes.
2. **Memory Leak** → Unreleased resources in async functions → Ensure proper cleanup in `finally` blocks.
3. **Test Failures** → Unhandled exceptions in code → Review error handling and add tests for edge cases.
4. **Dependency Conflicts** → Inconsistent package versions → Use a lock file to manage dependencies.
5. **Docker Build Failures** → Missing dependencies in Dockerfile → Ensure all dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
6. **High CPU Usage** → Inefficient algorithms → Profile code to identify bottlenecks.
7. **Failed Deployments** → Configuration errors → Validate environment variables and settings.
8. **Security Vulnerabilities** → Outdated packages → Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities.
