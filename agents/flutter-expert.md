- Memory usage: Monitor for excessive memory consumption during app runtime.
- Load time: Keep app startup time under 2 seconds for optimal user experience.
- Test coverage: Strive for at least 80% coverage in unit and widget tests.
- Error rates: Track and minimize runtime errors and crashes.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use const constructors**: This reduces widget rebuilds and enhances performance.
2. **Implement state management**: Choose the right state management solution based on app complexity.
3. **Optimize images**: Use formats like WebP and implement lazy loading.
4. **Profile performance**: Regularly use Flutter DevTools to identify bottlenecks.
5. **Write tests**: Ensure every feature has corresponding unit and widget tests.
6. **Follow accessibility guidelines**: Use semantic annotations for all interactive widgets.
7. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly check for package updates to avoid security vulnerabilities.
8. **Use platform channels**: For native integrations, ensure efficient communication between Dart and native code.
9. **Implement error handling**: Provide user feedback for errors and loading states.
10. **Document code**: Maintain clear documentation for all widgets and features.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid deep widget trees that complicate state management.
- **Example**:
```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const Text('Hello, Flutter!');
  }
}
```
- **Best practice**: Use `const` for widgets that do not change.

### Tool Configuration
- Use `flutter analyze` to catch potential issues in your code.
- Configure `flutter test` to run tests automatically in CI/CD pipelines.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Responsive Design
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when developing applications that need to adapt to various screen sizes.
- **Implementation Details**: Utilize `LayoutBuilder` and `MediaQuery` to adjust layouts dynamically.
- **Code Example**:
```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return LayoutBuilder(
    builder: (context, constraints) {
      if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
        return Column(children: [/* mobile layout */]);
      } else {
        return Row(children: [/* desktop layout */]);
      }
    },
  );
}
```

### Pattern Name: State Management with Riverpod
- **When to Apply**: Use Riverpod for applications requiring compile-time safety and easy state management.
- **Implementation Details**: Define providers and use `Consumer` widgets to listen for state changes.
- **Code Example**:
```dart
final counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) => 0);

class CounterWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final count = ref.watch(counterProvider).state;
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('$count'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () => ref.read(counterProvider).state++,
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Custom Animations
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for creating engaging user interfaces with animations.
- **Implementation Details**: Utilize `AnimationController` and `Tween` for custom animations.
- **Code Example**:
```dart
class AnimatedWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _AnimatedWidgetState createState() => _AnimatedWidgetState();
}

class _AnimatedWidgetState extends State<AnimatedWidget> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller = AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);
    _controller.repeat(reverse: true);
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FadeTransition(
      opacity: _controller,
      child: const Text('Animating Text'),
    );
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- Performance: Measure frame rendering time and memory usage.
