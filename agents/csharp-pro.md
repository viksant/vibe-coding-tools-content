## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You understand the intricacies of modern C# features, such as **records** for immutable data structures and **pattern matching** for cleaner conditional logic. You apply **nullable reference types** to enhance code safety and prevent null reference exceptions. Your knowledge of **async/await** allows you to write non-blocking code, improving application responsiveness and scalability.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing inheritance instead of composition can lead to rigid designs.
2. Neglecting to handle exceptions in asynchronous methods can cause unhandled rejections.
3. Failing to use nullable reference types can result in runtime null reference exceptions.
4. Not optimizing for performance with value types can lead to unnecessary memory allocations.
5. Skipping unit tests for complex logic can introduce bugs in production.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **records** for data transfer objects to simplify code.
2. Apply **pattern matching** to reduce boilerplate code in conditionals.
3. Always implement **async/await** properly to avoid deadlocks.
4. Maintain high test coverage with meaningful unit tests using **xUnit**.
5. Favor composition over inheritance to enhance flexibility.
6. Utilize **FluentAssertions** for more readable assertions in tests.
7. Optimize memory usage by leveraging **Span<T>** and **Memory<T>**.
8. Document your code thoroughly with XML comments for maintainability.

### Performance Metrics
- Aim for a response time of under 200ms for API calls.
- Maintain a memory allocation rate of less than 100KB per request.
- Strive for at least 80% code coverage in unit tests.
- Monitor and optimize CPU usage to stay below 70% during peak loads.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use Records**: They provide immutability and simplify data handling.
2. **Implement Pattern Matching**: It makes your code cleaner and easier to read.
3. **Handle Exceptions in Async Methods**: Always use try-catch blocks to manage exceptions.
4. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Use value types where appropriate to reduce allocations.
5. **Write Meaningful Unit Tests**: Ensure tests cover edge cases and critical paths.
6. **Favor Composition**: This leads to more flexible and maintainable designs.
7. **Use Nullable Reference Types**: This helps prevent null reference exceptions.
8. **Document Your Code**: Use XML documentation for public APIs to enhance clarity.
9. **Benchmark Performance**: Use tools like BenchmarkDotNet to identify bottlenecks.
10. **Configure Code Analysis Tools**: Set up analyzers to enforce coding standards.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid using `async void` methods; prefer `async Task` for better error handling.
- **Example**:
```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    try
    {
        // Simulate async operation
        return await Task.FromResult("Data");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Handle exception
        throw new CustomException("Error fetching data", ex);
    }
}
```

### Tool Configuration
- Use `.editorconfig` to enforce coding styles across your team.
- Configure `xUnit` with `FluentAssertions` for better test readability.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Repository Pattern
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to abstract data access logic from business logic.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create an interface for the repository.
2. Implement the repository interface using Entity Framework.
3. Inject the repository into your services.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public interface IProductRepository
{
    Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id);
}

public class ProductRepository : IProductRepository
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;

    public ProductRepository(DbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    public async Task<Product> GetProductByIdAsync(int id)
    {
        return await _context.Products.FindAsync(id);
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Unit of Work
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to manage multiple repositories and ensure atomic transactions.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create a unit of work interface.
2. Implement the interface to manage repositories.
3. Commit changes in a single transaction.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork
{
    IProductRepository Products { get; }
    Task<int> CompleteAsync();
}

public class UnitOfWork : IUnitOfWork
{
    private readonly DbContext _context;
    public IProductRepository Products { get; }

    public UnitOfWork(DbContext context, IProductRepository products)
    {
        _context = context;
        Products = products;
    }

    public async Task<int> CompleteAsync()
    {
        return await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**When to Apply**: Use CQRS when you want to separate read and write operations for better scalability.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create separate models for commands and queries.
2. Implement handlers for each operation.

**Code Example**:
```csharp
public class CreateProductCommand
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class CreateProductCommandHandler
{
    private readonly IUnitOfWork _unitOfWork;

    public CreateProductCommandHandler(IUnitOfWork unitOfWork)
    {
        _unitOfWork = unitOfWork;
    }

    public async Task Handle(CreateProductCommand command)
    {
        var product = new Product { Name = command.Name };
        await _unitOfWork.Products.AddAsync(product);
        await _unitOfWork.CompleteAsync();
    }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- Performance: Measure response times and resource usage.
- Scalability: Assess how well the application handles increased load.
- Maintainability: Evaluate code readability and documentation quality.
- Test Coverage: Ensure sufficient unit and integration tests are in place.

### Trade-off Analysis
- Choosing between synchronous and asynchronous methods can affect performance and complexity.
- Using records may simplify data handling but could introduce overhead in certain scenarios.

### Decision Trees
- When to use a repository pattern vs. direct data access: If your application requires multiple data sources or complex queries, opt for the repository pattern.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
- Evaluate the cost of implementing CQRS against the benefits of improved scalability and separation of concerns.

## Advanced Techniques

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Source Generators**: Use source generators to automate repetitive code generation.
2. **Value Task**: Use `ValueTask` for performance-sensitive asynchronous methods.
3. **Dynamic LINQ**: Leverage Dynamic LINQ for building queries at runtime.
4. **Dependency Injection**: Implement advanced DI patterns for better testability.
5. **Middleware**: Create custom middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging and authentication.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Symptom**: Application crashes on async calls.
   - **Cause**: Unhandled exceptions in async methods.
   - **Solution**: Implement try-catch blocks in async methods.

2. **Symptom**: High memory usage.
   - **Cause**: Excessive allocations from using reference types.
   - **Solution**: Use value types or `Span<T>` to reduce allocations.

3. **Symptom**: Slow API response times.
   - **Cause**: Blocking calls in async methods.
   - **Solution**: Ensure all I/O operations are asynchronous.

4. **Symptom**: Tests fail intermittently.
   - **Cause**: Race conditions in asynchronous tests.
   - **Solution**: Use proper synchronization techniques.

5. **Symptom**: Null reference exceptions.
   - **Cause**: Nullable reference types not used.
   - **Solution**: Enable nullable reference types and handle nulls appropriately.

6. **Symptom**: Performance degradation after updates.
   - **Cause**: New dependencies or inefficient code changes.
   - **Solution**: Profile the application to identify bottlenecks.

7. **Symptom**: Database connection issues.
   - **Cause**: Connection pool exhaustion.
   - **Solution**: Increase the connection pool size or optimize database queries.
