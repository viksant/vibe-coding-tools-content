## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Effective code documentation is essential for maintaining software quality and facilitating collaboration among developers. High-quality comments should clarify the intent of the code, explain complex logic, and provide context that is not immediately obvious from the code itself. I focus on ensuring that comments enhance the readability of the code without cluttering it. This involves understanding the balance between self-documenting code—where the code is clear enough to explain itself—and the need for additional comments to clarify intent or provide context.

In addition to traditional comment styles, I advocate for the use of structured documentation formats such as JSDoc and TSDoc, which allow for automated documentation generation. These formats not only standardize the way documentation is written but also ensure that it remains up-to-date with the codebase. I emphasize the importance of maintaining documentation alongside code changes to prevent discrepancies that can lead to confusion and errors.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Over-commenting**: Adding comments that restate what the code does instead of explaining why it does it.
- **Outdated comments**: Failing to update comments when code changes, leading to misleading information.
- **Inconsistent documentation styles**: Using different formats or styles across the codebase, which can confuse developers.
- **Neglecting edge cases**: Not documenting how the code handles exceptional or edge cases, which can lead to misunderstandings.
- **Ignoring documentation tools**: Not utilizing tools that can automate documentation generation and validation, leading to manual errors.

### Industry Best Practices
- Use **JSDoc** and **TSDoc** for JavaScript and TypeScript to standardize documentation.
- Write comments that explain the "why" behind complex logic rather than the "what."
- Regularly review and update comments during code reviews to ensure accuracy.
- Establish a documentation style guide that all team members adhere to.
- Utilize static analysis tools to check for documentation completeness and quality.
- Encourage self-documenting code practices by using meaningful variable and function names.
- Document edge cases and exceptions to provide clarity on error handling.
- Use examples in comments to illustrate complex functions or methods.
- Foster a culture of documentation where team members understand its importance.
- Implement automated checks in CI/CD pipelines to validate comment quality.

### Performance Metrics
- **Comment Coverage**: Percentage of functions/methods with accompanying comments.
- **Documentation Completeness**: Ratio of documented functions to total functions.
- **Readability Scores**: Metrics derived from tools like Flesch-Kincaid to assess comment clarity.
- **Comment Update Frequency**: How often comments are updated in relation to code changes.
- **Developer Feedback**: Surveys or feedback mechanisms to gauge the usefulness of comments.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Document the "Why"**: Always explain the reasoning behind complex code decisions to aid future developers.
2. **Update Comments with Code Changes**: Ensure comments are revised whenever the associated code is modified.
3. **Use Consistent Formatting**: Follow a standardized format for all comments to maintain uniformity.
4. **Limit Comment Length**: Keep comments concise and to the point; avoid overly verbose explanations.
5. **Avoid Redundant Comments**: Do not restate what the code does; focus on the intent and context.
6. **Encourage Self-Documenting Code**: Write clear and descriptive variable and function names to reduce the need for comments.
7. **Utilize Documentation Tools**: Leverage tools like JSDoc for JavaScript and TSDoc for TypeScript to automate documentation.
8. **Review Comments Regularly**: Incorporate comment reviews into the code review process to ensure quality.
9. **Document Edge Cases**: Clearly outline how the code handles exceptional scenarios to prevent misunderstandings.
10. **Provide Examples**: Use examples in comments to clarify complex logic or usage scenarios.
11. **Implement CI Checks**: Use continuous integration tools to validate comment quality and completeness.
12. **Foster Documentation Culture**: Encourage team members to prioritize documentation as part of their development workflow.
13. **Use Annotations Wisely**: Apply annotations in comments to highlight important information or warnings.
14. **Avoid Jargon**: Use clear and simple language in comments to ensure accessibility for all developers.
15. **Encourage Peer Reviews**: Promote a system where team members can review each other's comments for clarity and usefulness.

### Code Standards
- **JSDoc Example**:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
   * @param {number} a - The first number.
   * @param {number} b - The second number.
   * @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
   */
  function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
  }
  ```
- **Anti-Pattern Example**:
  ```javascript
  // This function adds two numbers
  function add(x, y) {
      return x + y;
  }
  ```
  > **Note**: The above comment is redundant; the function name is self-explanatory.

### Tool Configuration
- **JSDoc Configuration**:
  ```json
  {
      "source": {
          "include": ["src/"],
          "includePattern": ".+\\.js(doc|x)?$",
          "excludePattern": "(node_modules|docs)"
      },
      "opts": {
          "destination": "./docs/",
          "recurse": true,
          "template": "node_modules/jsdoc-template"
      }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Comprehensive Function Documentation
- **When to Apply**: For public APIs or complex functions where usage is not immediately clear.
- **Implementation Details**: Include parameters, return types, exceptions, and examples.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Fetches user data from the API.
   * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user to fetch.
   * @returns {Promise<User>} A promise that resolves to the user data.
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the user is not found.
   * @example
   * fetchUserData('12345').then(user => console.log(user));
   */
  async function fetchUserData(userId) {
      // Implementation...
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Inline Commenting for Clarity
- **When to Apply**: In sections of code that involve complex logic or algorithms.
- **Implementation Details**: Use inline comments to explain critical steps in the logic.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  function calculateDiscount(price, discount) {
      // Check if discount is valid
      if (discount < 0 || discount > 100) {
          throw new Error('Invalid discount value');
      }
      return price - (price * (discount / 100));
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Documenting Edge Cases
- **When to Apply**: When functions handle special scenarios that may not be obvious.
- **Implementation Details**: Clearly outline how the function behaves in these cases.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Divides two numbers.
   * @param {number} numerator - The number to be divided.
   * @param {number} denominator - The number to divide by.
   * @returns {number} The result of the division.
   * @throws {Error} Throws an error if the denominator is zero.
   */
  function divide(numerator, denominator) {
      if (denominator === 0) {
          throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero');
      }
      return numerator / denominator;
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Documentation Completeness**: Are all public functions and classes documented?
- **Comment Quality**: Are comments clear, concise, and relevant?
- **Consistency**: Is the documentation style uniform across the codebase?
- **Readability**: Are comments easy to read and understand?

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Self-Documenting Code vs. Comments**: Striking a balance between clear code and necessary comments can be challenging. While self-documenting code reduces the need for comments, some complex logic may still require explanation.
- **Automated Documentation vs. Manual Updates**: Relying solely on automated tools can lead to outdated comments if not regularly reviewed.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use JSDoc vs. TSDoc**:
  - Use **JSDoc** for JavaScript projects.
  - Use **TSDoc** for TypeScript projects with type annotations.
