   - *Why*: Helm simplifies deployment and management of applications through templating.

10. **Plan for Disaster Recovery**: Implement robust backup and recovery strategies.
    - *Why*: This ensures business continuity in case of failures.

### Code Standards
- **Use YAML for Kubernetes Manifests**: Ensure all configurations are in YAML format for clarity and compatibility.
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming conventions for resources to improve readability.
- **Version Control All Configurations**: Store all configuration files in a version control system like Git.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets**: Use tools like HashiCorp Vault for managing sensitive information.
- **Implement Linting for YAML Files**: Use tools like kubeval to validate your YAML files before deployment.

### Tool Configuration
- **Prometheus Configuration**: Set up Prometheus with the following scrape configuration for monitoring:
  ```yaml
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'kubernetes-nodes'
      kubernetes_sd_configs:
        - role: node
  ```
- **ArgoCD Application Definition**: Create an application in ArgoCD with the following manifest:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
  kind: Application
  metadata:
    name: my-app
  spec:
    source:
      repoURL: 'https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git'
      path: 'k8s'
      targetRevision: HEAD
    destination:
      server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
      namespace: my-app
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Multi-Cluster Management
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across different environments or regions.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Set up a central management cluster.
2. Use Cluster API to manage the lifecycle of your clusters.
3. Implement cross-cluster networking for service communication.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  controlPlane:
    ref:
      apiVersion: controlplane.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha3
      kind: KubeadmControlPlane
      name: my-cluster-control-plane
```

### Pattern Name: Progressive Delivery with Argo Rollouts
**When to Apply**: Implement this pattern for safe and controlled application releases.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define a Rollout resource in Kubernetes.
2. Use traffic splitting to gradually shift traffic to the new version.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: my-app-rollout
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    canary:
      steps:
        - setWeight: 20
        - pause: {}
        - setWeight: 100
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:v2
```

### Pattern Name: GitOps Workflow Implementation
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern to establish a GitOps workflow for application deployments.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Set up a Git repository for your application manifests.
2. Configure ArgoCD to monitor the repository and deploy changes automatically.

**Code Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  source:
    repoURL: 'https://github.com/my-org/my-app.git'
    path: 'k8s'
  destination:
    server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
    namespace: my-app
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the architecture can scale with increased load.
- **Cost**: Evaluate the cost implications of different architectural choices.
- **Security**: Consider the security posture of the proposed architecture.
- **Complexity**: Analyze the complexity of implementation and maintenance.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Managed vs. Self-Managed Clusters**: Managed services reduce operational overhead but may limit customization.
- **GitOps vs. Traditional CI/CD**: GitOps provides better version control but requires a cultural shift in deployment practices.
- **Service Mesh vs. No Service Mesh**: A service mesh adds complexity but provides enhanced observability and security.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use a Service Mesh**: 
  - If you need advanced traffic management, choose a service mesh.
  - If your application is simple and doesn’t require complex routing, avoid the overhead.
