## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime that outperforms traditional runtimes like Node.js. Its built-in bundler allows for native code execution, which can significantly cut down startup times and enhance runtime performance. Understanding Bun's architecture, including its event loop and memory management, is essential for optimizing applications.

Bun's bundling capabilities help developers package their applications efficiently. By using tree-shaking and dead code elimination, Bun can reduce the final bundle size, leading to faster load times. Plus, its support for TypeScript ensures that developers can tap into modern JavaScript features without sacrificing performance.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Native Bundling**: Not using Bun's native bundling can result in larger bundle sizes and slower load times.
2. **Neglecting TypeScript Configuration**: Misconfigured TypeScript settings can lead to inefficient transpilation and errors at runtime.
3. **Overusing Dependencies**: Adding too many dependencies can bloat the bundle size and hurt performance.
4. **Not Profiling Performance**: Skipping performance profiling may mean missing out on crucial optimization opportunities.
5. **Misconfiguring Package Installations**: Incorrect package management can create version conflicts and runtime issues.
6. **Underestimating Test Execution Time**: Not optimizing test runs can slow down development and affect CI/CD pipelines.
7. **Ignoring Bun-Specific APIs**: Not leveraging Bun's APIs can limit performance enhancements.

### Industry Best Practices
1. **Utilize Bun's Native Bundler**: Always opt for Bun's built-in bundler for the best performance and smaller bundle sizes.
2. **Optimize TypeScript Settings**: Set TypeScript for performance by enabling incremental builds and using the `--noEmitOnError` flag.
3. **Implement Tree-Shaking**: Ensure that tree-shaking is active to remove unused code from your bundles.
4. **Profile Regularly**: Use profiling tools to keep an eye on performance and find bottlenecks.
5. **Minimize Dependencies**: Audit your dependencies regularly and eliminate any that are unnecessary.
6. **Leverage Caching**: Utilize Bun's caching features to speed up installations and test executions.
7. **Optimize Test Suites**: Structure test suites to run in parallel, reducing execution time.
8. **Monitor Runtime Metrics**: Track memory usage and event loop delays to ensure optimal performance.
9. **Use Environment Variables**: Manage different environments effectively using environment variables.
10. **Document Configuration**: Keep clear documentation of your Bun configurations for easier onboarding and troubleshooting.

### Performance Metrics
- **Startup Time**: Measure how long it takes for the application to become responsive.
- **Bundle Size**: Track the size of the final bundle to keep it within acceptable limits.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during runtime to detect potential leaks.
- **Test Execution Time**: Measure how long test suites take to complete.
- **API Response Times**: Keep an eye on API response times to ensure they meet performance expectations.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Use Bun's Native Bundler**: This guarantees optimal performance and smaller bundles.
   - *Why*: Native bundling reduces overhead and speeds up execution.
   
2. **Configure TypeScript for Performance**: Enable `strict` mode and `incremental` builds in `tsconfig.json`.
   - *Why*: This minimizes build times and catches errors early.

3. **Enable Tree-Shaking**: Make sure your bundler allows for tree-shaking to eliminate unused code.
   - *Why*: This reduces bundle size and improves load times.

4. **Profile Your Application Regularly**: Use tools like `bun profile` to spot performance bottlenecks.
   - *Why*: Regular profiling helps maintain optimal performance.

5. **Minimize External Dependencies**: Regularly check and remove unnecessary packages.
   - *Why*: Fewer dependencies lead to smaller bundles and less complexity.

6. **Optimize Test Execution**: Structure tests to run in parallel and use `bun-test` effectively.
   - *Why*: This speeds up the feedback loop during development.

7. **Leverage Bun-Specific APIs**: Use Bun's APIs for file handling and HTTP requests to boost performance.
   - *Why*: These APIs are tailored for Bun's runtime.

8. **Use Environment Variables for Configuration**: Manage different environments using environment variables.
   - *Why*: This allows for flexible configuration without altering code.

9. **Document All Configurations**: Keep clear documentation for all Bun settings and optimizations.
   - *Why*: This aids in onboarding and troubleshooting.

10. **Monitor Runtime Performance Metrics**: Track memory usage and event loop delays.
    - *Why*: Monitoring allows you to identify performance issues before they affect users.

### Code Standards
- **Pattern**: Use ES6 modules for imports and exports.
  ```javascript
  import { myFunction } from './myModule.js';
  export const anotherFunction = () => { /* ... */ };
  ```

- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid using CommonJS `require` statements.
  ```javascript
  // Avoid this
  const myModule = require('./myModule');
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Bun Configuration Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "my-bun-app",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "scripts": {
      "start": "bun run src/index.ts",
      "test": "bun test"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "elysia": "^0.1.0",
      "hono": "^0.2.0"
    }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Efficient API Handling
- **When to Apply**: Use this when building applications that require frequent API calls.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Utilize Bun's built-in fetch API for requests.
  2. Implement caching for API responses to cut down load times.
  3. Use async/await for managing asynchronous calls.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const fetchData = async (url) => {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    return await response.json();
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Optimized Test Suites
- **When to Apply**: During development for quick feedback.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Structure tests to run in parallel using `bun-test`.
  2. Use setup and teardown hooks to manage test environments.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { test } from 'bun:test';

  test('example test', async () => {
    const result = await fetchData('/api/data');
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: TypeScript Integration
- **When to Apply**: When developing applications with TypeScript and Bun.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set up `tsconfig.json` for optimal performance.
  2. Use Bun's TypeScript support for easy transpilation.
  
- **Code Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "ESNext",
      "module": "ESNext",
      "strict": true,
      "incremental": true
    }
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance Metrics**: Look at startup time, bundle size, and memory usage.
- **Development Speed**: Assess how quickly features can be developed and tested.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate how easy it is to maintain the codebase.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Bundling vs. Development Speed**: Native bundling may slow down initial development but boosts performance in production.
- **Dependency Management**: Cutting down on dependencies can enhance performance but might limit functionality.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Bun vs. Traditional Runtimes**:
  - Choose Bun if performance is critical and you need native bundling.
  - Stick with Node.js for legacy applications with many dependencies.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Option               | Cost (Time/Complexity) | Benefit (Performance/Speed) |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Native Bundling      | Medium                 | High                         |
| Using External Libraries | Low                  | Medium                       |
| Manual Optimization   | High                   | Very High                    |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Native Code Execution**: Take advantage of Bun's ability to run native code in performance-sensitive areas of your application.
2. **Custom Middleware in Elysia**: Create custom middleware for handling requests, optimizing API performance.
