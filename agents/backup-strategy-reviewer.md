  #!/bin/bash
  set -e  # Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status

  export RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/path/to/backup
  export RESTIC_PASSWORD='yourpassword'

  restic backup /important/data --tag daily
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Backup successful"
  else
      echo "Backup failed" >&2
      exit 1
  fi
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Velero Configuration Example**:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: velero.io/v1
  kind: Backup
  metadata:
    name: my-backup
  spec:
    includedNamespaces:
      - "*"
    storageLocation: default
    ttl: 720h0m0s  # Retain backups for 30 days
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Incremental Backup Strategy
- **When to Apply**: When storage costs are a concern, and backup windows need to be minimized.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Schedule full backups weekly.
  2. Configure incremental backups daily to capture changes since the last backup.
  3. Use deduplication to optimize storage.
- **Code Example**:
  ```bash
  # Full backup command
  borg create --stats /path/to/repo::'{now:%Y-%m-%d}' /important/data

  # Incremental backup command
  borg create --stats /path/to/repo::'{now:%Y-%m-%d}-incremental' /important/data --last-archive
  ```

### Pattern Name: Offsite Backup Storage
- **When to Apply**: When compliance requires data to be stored offsite or to protect against local disasters.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Choose a cloud provider for offsite storage.
  2. Schedule regular uploads of backup data to the cloud.
  3. Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **Code Example**:
  ```bash
  # Example of using AWS CLI to sync local backups to S3
  aws s3 sync /local/backup s3://my-backup-bucket --storage-class STANDARD_IA
  ```

### Pattern Name: Automated Backup Verification
- **When to Apply**: When ensuring data integrity is critical to business operations.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Schedule automated scripts to verify backups after completion.
  2. Log results and alert if verification fails.
- **Code Example**:
  ```bash
  # Verification script for Restic
  restic check --read-data
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Backup verification successful"
  else
      echo "Backup verification failed" >&2
      exit 1
  fi
  ```
