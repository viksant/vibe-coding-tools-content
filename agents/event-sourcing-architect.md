## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Event sourcing captures every change to an application state as a series of events. This method allows for the complete reconstruction of the state at any point by replaying those events. This differs from traditional CRUD models, which only retain the current state. When paired with CQRS, which separates reading and writing operations, event sourcing enhances scalability and performance by allowing distinct models for data operations.

In an event-sourced system, each change is recorded as an unchangeable event in an event store, creating a reliable audit trail. Since these events can't be altered after being recorded, this immutability is key for preserving data integrity and consistency. Plus, having an event store simplifies event replay, which is useful for debugging, testing, and system migrations.

Sagas play a crucial role in managing long-running business processes that involve multiple services. They ensure that all parts of a distributed transaction either complete successfully or roll back if any part fails. Setting up sagas can be complex, requiring careful orchestration and error handling to maintain consistency across services.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Ignoring Event Versioning**: Not considering changes in event structure can lead to issues during event replay.
- **Overloading Events**: Creating overly complex events can slow down performance and complicate processing.
- **Neglecting Event Store Performance**: Failing to optimize the event store can result in slow reads and writes, affecting the systemâ€™s overall performance.
- **Inadequate Saga Management**: Poorly designed sagas can create inconsistent states and complicate error recovery.
- **Underestimating Eventual Consistency**: Misunderstanding the implications of eventual consistency can lead to user experience issues and data anomalies.
- **Lack of Monitoring**: Without proper monitoring and logging, diagnosing issues in event-driven systems becomes challenging.
- **Ignoring Security**: Not securing event data can expose sensitive information and create compliance risks.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Use Event Versioning**: Implement versioning for events to handle changes smoothly and maintain backward compatibility.
- **Design Small, Focused Events**: Keep events concise and focused on a single change to simplify processing and boost performance.
- **Optimize Event Store Queries**: Use effective indexing for event data to enhance query performance and reduce latency.
- **Implement Saga Patterns**: Choose choreography or orchestration patterns for sagas based on the complexity of the business process.
- **Embrace Eventual Consistency**: Design systems with eventual consistency in mind, ensuring users are aware of its implications.
- **Monitor Event Processing**: Establish comprehensive monitoring and alerting for event processing to quickly identify and resolve issues.
- **Secure Event Data**: Use encryption and access controls to safeguard sensitive event data.
- **Automate Event Replay**: Create automated processes for event replay to simplify testing and recovery.
- **Document Event Schemas**: Keep clear documentation of event schemas for better understanding and maintenance.
- **Conduct Regular Audits**: Regularly audit event stores and processing logic to ensure compliance and performance.

### Performance Metrics
- **Event Processing Latency**: Track the time it takes to process events from publication to consumption.
- **Throughput**: Monitor the number of events processed every second to assess system capacity.
- **Error Rate**: Keep an eye on the rate of failed event processing attempts to spot issues.
- **Event Store Size**: Monitor the size of the event store to manage storage and performance effectively.
- **Saga Completion Time**: Measure how long it takes for sagas to finish to ensure efficiency in long-running processes.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Version Events**: Implement versioning to gracefully handle changes in event structure without disrupting existing consumers.
   - *Why*: This maintains backward compatibility and allows for smooth transitions when updating event schemas.

2. **Keep Events Immutable**: Create events as immutable objects to guarantee data integrity.
   - *Why*: Immutability ensures that once an event is recorded, it remains unchanged, preserving history.

3. **Use Eventual Consistency**: Accept that eventual consistency is a legitimate approach in distributed systems.
   - *Why*: This improves performance and scalability, particularly in microservices architectures.

4. **Design for Idempotency**: Make sure event handlers are idempotent to safely process duplicate events.
   - *Why*: This avoids unintended consequences from processing the same event multiple times.

5. **Implement Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers in event processing to handle failures smoothly.
   - *Why*: This prevents cascading failures and allows the system to recover from temporary issues.

6. **Monitor Event Flow**: Set up monitoring for event flow and processing times to identify bottlenecks.
   - *Why*: This helps maintain performance and quickly address issues as they arise.

7. **Use a Reliable Message Broker**: Opt for a strong message broker like Kafka or RabbitMQ for event distribution.
   - *Why*: This ensures events are delivered reliably and effectively decouples services.

8. **Optimize Event Store Configuration**: Fine-tune event store settings for performance based on usage patterns.
   - *Why*: Proper configuration can significantly boost read and write speeds.

9. **Document Business Logic in Sagas**: Clearly outline the business logic and flow of sagas for future reference.
   - *Why*: This aids maintenance and understanding of complex workflows.

10. **Test Event Replay**: Regularly verify the event replay functionality to ensure data integrity and recovery capabilities.
    - *Why*: This guarantees the system can recover from failures without data loss.

11. **Implement Backpressure**: Use backpressure strategies to manage load during peak times.
    - *Why*: This prevents system overload and maintains performance during high traffic.

12. **Separate Read and Write Models**: Clearly define and separate the read and write models in your architecture.
    - *Why*: This improves performance and allows for optimized querying.

13. **Use Distributed Transactions Sparingly**: Avoid distributed transactions when possible; prefer sagas for complex workflows.
    - *Why*: Distributed transactions can add complexity and performance challenges.

14. **Leverage Event Replay for Testing**: Use event replay in testing environments to simulate real-world scenarios.
    - *Why*: This validates the system's behavior under various conditions.

15. **Regularly Review Event Schema**: Periodically reassess and refine event schemas to keep them relevant and efficient.
    - *Why*: This maintains a clean system and avoids unnecessary complexity.

### Code Standards
- **Event Structure Example**:
```java
public class OrderCreatedEvent {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerId;
    private final List<Item> items;
    private final LocalDateTime createdAt;

    public OrderCreatedEvent(String orderId, String customerId, List<Item> items) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.items = items;
        this.createdAt = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    // Getters and other methods...
}
```
- **Saga Example**:
```java
public class OrderSaga {
    @StartSaga
    public void handle(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        // Start the saga process
        // Send a command to reserve items
    }

    @SagaEventHandler
    public void handle(ItemReservedEvent event) {
        // Continue saga if items are reserved
    }

    @SagaEventHandler
    public void handle(ItemReservationFailedEvent event) {
        // Compensate if reservation fails
    }
}
```

### Tool Configuration
- **EventStore Configuration Example**:
```yaml
eventstore:
  db:
    connectionString: "tcp://admin:changeit@localhost:1113"
    maxConnections: 100
    maxRetries: 10
```
- **Kafka Producer Configuration**:
```properties

```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Event Sourcing with CQRS
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when building systems that need high scalability and maintainability, especially in complex domains.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Clearly define commands and queries separately.
  2. Implement event sourcing for command handling.
  3. Use projections for query handling.
  4. Ensure event handlers are idempotent.
  
- **Code Example**:
```java
// Command Handler
public void handle(CreateOrderCommand command) {
    OrderCreatedEvent event = new OrderCreatedEvent(command.getOrderId(), command.getCustomerId(), command.getItems());
    eventStore.save(event);
}

// Query Handler
public OrderDto getOrder(String orderId) {
    return projectionRepository.findById(orderId);
}
```

### Pattern Name: Saga Orchestration
- **When to Apply**: Use this when managing complex business processes across multiple services that require coordination.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define the saga's steps and compensating actions.
  2. Use a centralized orchestrator or decentralized choreography.
  3. Handle failures and retries appropriately.
  
- **Code Example**:
```java
public class OrderSaga {
    @StartSaga
    public void handle(OrderCreatedEvent event) {
        // Start the saga and reserve items
    }

    @SagaEventHandler
    public void handle(ItemReservedEvent event) {
        // Proceed to payment
    }

    @SagaEventHandler
    public void handle(PaymentFailedEvent event) {
        // Compensate by releasing items
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Event Replay for Testing
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern in testing environments to validate system behavior under various scenarios.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Capture events during production.
  2. Replay events in a test environment.
  3. Validate the state of the system after replay.
  
- **Code Example**:
```java
public void replayEvents(List<Event> events) {
    for (Event event : events) {
        eventHandler.handle(event);
    }
}
```

## Decision Framework

## Advanced Techniques

### Event Schema Evolution
Use strategies like **upcasting** and **downcasting** to manage changes in event schemas without disrupting existing consumers. This facilitates smooth transitions when updating event structures.

### Snapshotting
Implement snapshotting to lessen the replay overhead. By periodically saving the state of an aggregate, you can speed up the recovery process.

### Event Compression
Apply event compression techniques to shrink the size of the event store. This can enhance performance and lower storage costs, especially in high-volume systems.

### Distributed Event Processing
Utilize frameworks like **Akka** for distributed event processing to handle high throughput and low latency in event-driven systems.

### CQRS with Read Replicas
Use read replicas to offload read operations from the primary database, boosting performance and scalability for read-heavy applications.

### Saga Patterns
Explore advanced saga patterns like **compensating transactions** and **event-driven sagas** for effective management of complex workflows.

### Event-Driven Microservices
Build microservices that communicate through events, promoting loose coupling and independent scaling.
