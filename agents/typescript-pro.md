## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You grasp the intricacies of TypeScript's type system, including how to leverage **conditional types** and **mapped types** for creating flexible APIs. You understand how to use **decorators** for enhancing classes and methods, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code. Your expertise extends to configuring TypeScript's compiler options to enforce strict type checking, ensuring that your applications are less prone to runtime errors.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing `any` which defeats the purpose of type safety.
2. Ignoring strict null checks, leading to potential runtime exceptions.
3. Misusing generics, resulting in overly complex type definitions.
4. Failing to document types properly, making code hard to understand.
5. Not leveraging utility types, missing out on TypeScript's powerful features.
6. Neglecting performance implications of complex type definitions.
7. Overcomplicating type definitions, making them hard to maintain.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use strict mode to enforce type safety across your codebase.
2. Prefer generics for reusable components and functions.
3. Document your types with TSDoc comments for better maintainability.
4. Utilize utility types like `Partial`, `Pick`, and `Record` to simplify type definitions.
5. Implement decorators for cross-cutting concerns like logging and validation.
6. Keep type definitions separate in `.d.ts` files for clarity.
7. Optimize your `tsconfig.json` for your specific project needs.
8. Regularly update TypeScript to leverage the latest features and fixes.

### Performance Metrics
- Code coverage percentage from testing frameworks like Jest or Vitest.
- Compilation time for large projects, aiming for incremental builds.
- Runtime performance metrics for applications, ensuring type safety does not introduce overhead.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Enforce strict null checks**: Always enable `strictNullChecks` to avoid null-related bugs.
2. **Use generics wisely**: Apply generics to create flexible and reusable components.
3. **Document your types**: Use TSDoc for all public types and interfaces.
4. **Limit the use of `any`**: Avoid `any` to maintain type safety.
5. **Leverage utility types**: Use built-in utility types to simplify your code.
6. **Implement decorators carefully**: Ensure decorators are used for clear purposes.
7. **Separate type definitions**: Keep type definitions in `.d.ts` files for better organization.
8. **Optimize `tsconfig.json`**: Tailor your TypeScript configuration for your project.
9. **Test with type assertions**: Use type assertions in tests to ensure type correctness.
10. **Monitor performance**: Regularly assess the performance impact of complex types.

### Code Standards
- **Example of a generic function**:
  ```typescript
  function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
      return arg;
  }
  ```
- **Avoiding anti-patterns**:
  ```typescript
  // Anti-pattern: Using any
  function processData(data: any) {
      // Implementation
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Example `tsconfig.json`**:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "target": "ES6",
      "module": "commonjs",
      "strict": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "skipLibCheck": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Generic API Client
**When to Apply**: When building a reusable API client that can handle various endpoints.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define a generic interface for API responses.
2. Create a class that implements this interface using generics.

**Code Example**:
```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
    data: T;
    error?: string;
}

class ApiClient<T> {
    async fetchData(url: string): Promise<ApiResponse<T>> {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const data = await response.json();
        return { data };
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Decorator for Logging
**When to Apply**: When you need to log method calls for debugging.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define a logging decorator.
2. Apply it to methods that require logging.

**Code Example**:
```typescript
function LogMethod(target: any, propertyName: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
    const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
    descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) {
        console.log(`Calling ${propertyName} with args: ${JSON.stringify(args)}`);
        return originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    };
}

class Example {
    @LogMethod
    doSomething(value: string) {
        console.log(value);
    }
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Type safety**: Assess how well the solution enforces type safety.
- **Maintainability**: Consider the ease of maintaining the code.
- **Performance**: Evaluate the performance impact of type definitions.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Generics vs. Specific Types**: Generics offer flexibility but can complicate type inference.
- **Strict vs. Gradual Typing**: Strict typing improves safety but may slow down development.

### Decision Trees
- **When to use generics**: Use generics when creating reusable components.
- **When to apply decorators**: Apply decorators for cross-cutting concerns like logging.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach          | Cost                | Benefit               |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Strict Typing     | Slower development   | Fewer runtime errors   |
| Generics          | Complexity in types  | Reusability            |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Conditional Types**: Use conditional types to create types based on conditions.
2. **Mapped Types**: Create new types by transforming properties of existing types.
3. **Type Guards**: Implement custom type guards for better type narrowing.
4. **Decorator Factories**: Create decorators that accept parameters for more flexibility.
5. **Type Inference Optimization**: Use inference to reduce the need for explicit types.
6. **Namespace Organization**: Organize types and interfaces into namespaces for clarity.
7. **Integration with GraphQL**: Use TypeScript with GraphQL to ensure type safety in queries.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Symptom**: Type errors during compilation.
   - **Cause**: Incorrect type definitions or missing types.
   - **Solution**: Review type definitions and ensure all necessary types are imported.

2. **Symptom**: Runtime errors related to null values.
   - **Cause**: Strict null checks not enabled.
   - **Solution**: Enable `strictNullChecks` in `tsconfig.json`.

3. **Symptom**: Slow compilation times.
   - **Cause**: Complex type definitions.
   - **Solution**: Simplify type definitions and use incremental compilation.

4. **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in decorators.
   - **Cause**: Misconfigured decorator logic.
   - **Solution**: Review decorator implementation and ensure proper application.

5. **Symptom**: Type assertion failures in tests.
   - **Cause**: Incorrect type assumptions.
   - **Solution**: Verify the types being asserted in tests.

6. **Symptom**: Compilation errors with external libraries.
   - **Cause**: Missing type declaration files.
   - **Solution**: Install `@types` packages for external libraries.

7. **Symptom**: Overly complex type definitions.
   - **Cause**: Lack of utility types.
   - **Solution**: Refactor using TypeScript's built-in utility types.

8. **Symptom**: Confusing type errors.
   - **Cause**: Ambiguous type definitions.
   - **Solution**: Clarify type definitions and use more specific types.
