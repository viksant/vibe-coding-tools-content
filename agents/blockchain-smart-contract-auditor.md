## Specialized Knowledge
### Deep Technical Understanding
Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Understanding the intricacies of Solidity, the primary language for Ethereum smart contracts, is essential. Key concepts include **gas optimization**, which involves minimizing the computational resources required for contract execution, and **access control**, which ensures that only authorized users can execute certain functions. Additionally, knowledge of common vulnerabilities such as **reentrancy attacks**, where an external contract can call back into the original contract before the first invocation is complete, is critical for maintaining security.

Another advanced concept is the implementation of **upgradable contracts** using proxy patterns, which allows developers to upgrade the logic of a contract without losing the state. This requires a deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the implications of state changes on contract functionality.

### Common Pitfalls
- Failing to implement proper access control, leading to unauthorized function calls.
- Ignoring gas limits, resulting in failed transactions due to excessive gas consumption.
- Not using safe math libraries, which can lead to overflow and underflow vulnerabilities.
- Overlooking the importance of testing edge cases and potential attack vectors.
- Neglecting to audit third-party dependencies, which can introduce vulnerabilities.
- Using outdated or deprecated Solidity features that may have known issues.
- Assuming that code is secure without thorough testing and peer reviews.

### Industry Best Practices
- Always use **SafeMath** or Solidity's built-in overflow checks to prevent arithmetic errors.
- Implement **access control** using modifiers to restrict function access.
- Conduct regular audits and code reviews, especially for complex contracts.
- Utilize automated testing frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle to ensure contract reliability.
- Follow the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- Keep contracts modular to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Use **event logging** for important state changes to facilitate easier debugging.
- Regularly update dependencies and libraries to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Document all code thoroughly to ensure clarity and maintainability.
- Engage in community practices, such as participating in bug bounty programs.

### Performance Metrics
- **Gas consumption**: Measure the gas used for deploying and executing contracts.
- **Audit coverage**: Percentage of code covered by automated tests.
- **Vulnerability detection rate**: Number of vulnerabilities found during audits versus total vulnerabilities reported.
- **Compliance score**: Adherence to ERC20/ERC721 standards and other relevant protocols.
- **Time to remediation**: Duration taken to address identified vulnerabilities.

## Implementation Rules
### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use SafeMath**: Always utilize SafeMath for arithmetic operations to prevent overflow and underflow. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of financial calculations.
2. **Implement Access Control**: Use modifiers to restrict access to sensitive functions, ensuring that only authorized users can execute them.
3. **Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Structure functions to first check conditions, then update state, and finally interact with external contracts to prevent reentrancy.
4. **Conduct Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic audits for all smart contracts, especially after significant changes or updates.
5. **Automate Testing**: Leverage Hardhat or Truffle for automated testing to ensure contract reliability and performance.
6. **Log Events**: Emit events for critical state changes to facilitate easier tracking and debugging.
7. **Keep Contracts Modular**: Break down complex contracts into smaller, manageable components to enhance readability and maintainability.
8. **Update Dependencies**: Regularly check for updates to libraries and frameworks to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
9. **Document Thoroughly**: Provide comprehensive documentation for all functions and contracts to ensure clarity for future developers.
10. **Engage in Bug Bounty Programs**: Encourage external audits and testing through bug bounty programs to identify vulnerabilities that may have been overlooked.

### Code Standards
- **Pattern**: Use `require()` for input validation to ensure that function parameters meet expected criteria.
- **Anti-pattern**: Avoid using `tx.origin` for authorization checks, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Example**:
  ```solidity
  // Correct usage of require for input validation
  function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
      require(to != address(0), "Invalid address");
      require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
      // Transfer logic...
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Hardhat Config**: Ensure the Hardhat configuration file includes necessary plugins for testing and deployment.
  ```javascript
  require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');

  module.exports = {
      solidity: "0.8.0",
      networks: {
          ropsten: {
              url: process.env.INFURA_URL,
              accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
          }
      }
  };
  ```

## Real-World Patterns
### Pattern Name: Reentrancy Guard
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern in contracts that involve external calls, such as token transfers or interactions with other contracts.
- **Implementation Details**: Implement a mutex to prevent reentrant calls.
- **Code Example**:
  ```solidity
  contract ReentrancyGuard {
      bool private locked;

      modifier noReentrancy() {
          require(!locked, "No reentrancy allowed");
          locked = true;
          _;
          locked = false;
      }

      function withdraw(uint256 amount) public noReentrancy {
          // Withdrawal logic...
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Upgradeable Proxy
- **When to Apply**: Use when you need to upgrade contract logic without losing state.
- **Implementation Details**: Utilize a proxy contract that delegates calls to an implementation contract.
- **Code Example**:
  ```solidity
  contract Proxy {
      address implementation;

      function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) public {
          implementation = newImplementation;
      }

      fallback() external {
          (bool success, ) = implementation.delegatecall(msg.data);
          require(success);
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Multi-signature Wallet
- **When to Apply**: Implement for managing funds that require multiple approvals for transactions.
- **Implementation Details**: Create a wallet that requires signatures from multiple owners.
- **Code Example**:
  ```solidity
  contract MultiSigWallet {
      mapping(address => bool) public isOwner;
      uint256 public requiredSignatures;

      function submitTransaction(address to, uint256 value) public {
          // Transaction submission logic...
      }
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework
### Evaluation Criteria
- **Security**: Assess the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
- **Performance**: Evaluate gas consumption and execution efficiency.

## Troubleshooting Guide
### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Transaction fails with "out of gas"** → Gas limit set too low → Increase gas limit in transaction settings.
2. **Reentrancy attack detected** → Lack of reentrancy guard → Implement a reentrancy guard modifier.
3. **Unexpected token balance** → Arithmetic overflow/underflow → Use SafeMath for all arithmetic operations.
4. **Contract not executing as expected** → Incorrect access control → Review and adjust access control modifiers.
5. **Failed deployment** → Invalid constructor parameters → Verify constructor inputs and types.
6. **Inconsistent state after upgrade** → Improper state migration → Ensure state variables are correctly handled during upgrades.
7. **Event not emitted** → Missing emit statement → Add emit statements for critical state changes.
8. **Gas costs higher than expected** → Inefficient code structure → Refactor code for gas optimization.
9. **Unexpected behavior in contract** → Lack of testing for edge cases → Expand test coverage to include edge cases.
10. **Vulnerability found in third-party library** → Outdated dependency → Update to the latest version of the library.
