## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You have a solid grasp of **Java 21+ features** such as virtual threads and pattern matching. Virtual threads simplify concurrency, allowing you to handle thousands of tasks without the overhead of traditional threads. Pattern matching enhances code readability and reduces boilerplate, making your applications cleaner and easier to maintain. 

In the **Spring ecosystem**, you utilize Spring Boot 3.x to build microservices that are both resilient and scalable. You implement Spring Cloud features for service discovery and load balancing, ensuring that your applications can handle varying loads efficiently. 

Your knowledge of **GraalVM** enables you to compile Java applications into native images, significantly improving startup times and reducing memory consumption. This is particularly beneficial for cloud deployments where resource efficiency is crucial.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Neglecting Virtual Thread Management**: Failing to manage virtual threads properly can lead to resource exhaustion.
2. **Ignoring Spring Boot Configuration**: Misconfiguring Spring Boot properties can result in performance bottlenecks.
3. **Overusing Synchronous Calls**: Relying too heavily on synchronous processing can hinder application responsiveness.
4. **Inadequate Testing**: Skipping integration tests can lead to unexpected failures in production.
5. **Poor Database Design**: Inefficient database schemas can cause slow queries and affect application performance.
6. **Not Utilizing Caching**: Failing to implement caching strategies can lead to unnecessary database load.
7. **Ignoring Security Best Practices**: Neglecting security measures can expose applications to vulnerabilities.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **virtual threads** for high-concurrency applications to reduce resource overhead.
2. Implement **circuit breaker patterns** to handle service failures gracefully.
3. Utilize **Spring Data JPA** for efficient data access and management.
4. Apply **CQRS** for separating read and write operations in your architecture.
5. Optimize **JVM settings** based on your application's workload characteristics.
6. Conduct **performance testing** regularly using tools like JMH.
7. Leverage **Docker** for consistent development and production environments.
8. Use **Spring Security** for robust authentication and authorization.
9. Implement **distributed tracing** for better observability in microservices.
10. Regularly update dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: Measure the number of transactions processed per second.
- **Latency**: Track response times for requests.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption and garbage collection pauses.
- **Error Rates**: Keep an eye on the frequency of errors in production.
- **CPU Utilization**: Assess how efficiently CPU resources are being used.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Embrace Virtual Threads**: Use virtual threads to handle high concurrency without the overhead of traditional threads.
2. **Configure Spring Boot Properly**: Set up application properties to optimize performance and resource usage.
3. **Implement Asynchronous Processing**: Use `CompletableFuture` for non-blocking operations.
4. **Use Caching Wisely**: Implement caching strategies to reduce database load and improve response times.
5. **Conduct Regular Performance Tests**: Use JMH to benchmark critical parts of your application.
6. **Optimize Database Queries**: Analyze and optimize slow queries to enhance overall performance.
7. **Utilize Dependency Injection**: Leverage Spring's DI capabilities to improve code maintainability.
8. **Document Architectural Decisions**: Keep track of design choices to aid future development.
9. **Monitor Application Health**: Use Spring Actuator to expose metrics and health checks.
10. **Secure Your Applications**: Follow OWASP guidelines to protect against common vulnerabilities.

### Code Standards
- **Use `var` for Local Variables**: It improves readability without sacrificing type safety.
- **Avoid Long Methods**: Keep methods short and focused on a single task.
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful names for classes and methods to enhance code clarity.
- **Implement Error Handling**: Always handle exceptions gracefully to avoid application crashes.

### Tool Configuration
- Configure **GraalVM** for native image builds to enhance startup performance.
- Set up **HikariCP** for efficient connection pooling in your Spring applications.
- Use **Flyway** or **Liquibase** for database migrations to maintain schema consistency.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Event-Driven Microservices
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when building scalable systems that require decoupled services.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define events that represent state changes in your domain.
2. Use a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) to publish and subscribe to events.
3. Implement event handlers in your microservices to react to events.

**Code Example**:
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    @Autowired
    private EventPublisher eventPublisher;

    public void placeOrder(Order order) {
        // Save order to database
        orderRepository.save(order);
        // Publish order placed event
        eventPublisher.publish(new OrderPlacedEvent(order));
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Circuit Breaker
**When to Apply**: Implement this pattern to prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Wrap calls to external services with a circuit breaker.
2. Define thresholds for failure rates and timeouts.
3. Switch to a fallback method when the circuit is open.

**Code Example**:
```java
@CircuitBreaker
public Order getOrder(String orderId) {
    return orderServiceClient.getOrder(orderId);
}
```

### Pattern Name: CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
**When to Apply**: Use CQRS when your application has complex business logic and requires separate read and write models.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Separate the command model (for writes) from the query model (for reads).
2. Use different data stores if necessary to optimize for read and write operations.

**Code Example**:
```java
public class OrderCommand {
    // Command properties
}

public class OrderQuery {
    // Query properties
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Assess the impact on response times and resource usage.
- **Scalability**: Determine how well the solution can handle increased load.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate how easy it is to update and extend the solution.
- **Security**: Check for vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards.

### Trade-off Analysis
- Choosing between synchronous vs. asynchronous processing can impact responsiveness and complexity.
- Using a single database vs. multiple databases can simplify transactions but complicate scaling.

### Decision Trees
- When to use virtual threads vs. platform threads:
  - Use virtual threads for high concurrency.
  - Use platform threads for CPU-bound tasks.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
- Compare the costs of implementing caching vs. the benefits of reduced database load.

## Advanced Techniques

1. **GraalVM Native Image**: Compile your applications to native images for faster startup and lower memory usage.
2. **Structured Concurrency**: Use structured concurrency patterns to manage lifecycles of concurrent tasks effectively.
3. **Reactive Programming**: Implement reactive programming with Spring WebFlux for handling asynchronous data streams.
4. **Distributed Tracing**: Use tools like OpenTelemetry for tracing requests across microservices.
5. **API Gateway**: Implement an API gateway for managing traffic and enforcing security policies.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **High Latency** → Database queries are slow → Optimize queries and add indexing.
2. **Memory Leaks** → Application crashes under load → Use memory profiling tools to identify leaks.
3. **Service Downtime** → Circuit breaker trips frequently → Review service dependencies and increase timeout settings.
4. **Slow Startup Times** → GraalVM native image not configured → Adjust GraalVM settings for optimal performance.
5. **Authentication Failures** → Incorrect OAuth2 configuration → Verify client credentials and redirect URIs.
6. **Data Inconsistency** → Event processing delays → Check message broker for backlogs and optimize processing logic.
7. **Connection Pool Exhaustion** → Too many concurrent requests → Increase connection pool size in HikariCP.
8. **Test Failures** → Environment mismatch → Ensure test containers match production configurations.
