## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Client-side storage options like LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB give developers handy tools for managing data directly in the browser. But these storage methods come with their own security risks. For example, LocalStorage operates synchronously and may cause performance issues if you store large amounts of data. On the flip side, IndexedDB works asynchronously and supports more complex data structures, but it requires careful handling to avoid security flaws.

Encryption plays a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information. By using libraries like crypto-js, you can encrypt data before storing it, ensuring that even if someone accesses the storage, the data remains protected. Understanding the data lifecycle in storage is also key for effective expiration policies, helping to reduce risks related to outdated information.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Storing Sensitive Data in Plain Text**: Many developers forget the importance of encryption, leaving sensitive data exposed.
- **Neglecting Storage Quotas**: Not managing storage limits can lead to application crashes or slower performance.
- **Inadequate XSS Protection**: Failing to properly validate and sanitize input can make storage vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **Ignoring GDPR Compliance**: Some applications overlook user consent and data protection laws, risking legal issues.
- **Overusing LocalStorage**: Relying too much on LocalStorage can result in performance challenges and security risks.
- **Not Implementing Data Expiration**: Keeping data indefinitely can raise privacy concerns and lead to unnecessary data retention.
- **Lack of Security Audits**: Skipping regular audits of storage implementations can leave vulnerabilities unchecked.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Always Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Use strong encryption methods (like AES) with libraries such as crypto-js before storing any data.
- **Implement Data Expiration Policies**: Set expiration times for stored data to reduce risks tied to outdated information.
- **Use IndexedDB for Complex Data**: Opt for IndexedDB for larger datasets and complex queries since it offers better performance and security.
- **Regularly Review Storage Usage**: Keep an eye on storage usage and optimize it to stay within browser limits and enhance performance.
- **Sanitize User Input**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to protect against XSS attacks that could compromise storage.

const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
    const tempDiv = document.createElement('div');
    tempDiv.innerText = input; // Escapes HTML
    return tempDiv.innerHTML;
};
```
- **Data Expiration Example**:
```javascript
const setItemWithExpiration = (key, value, ttl) => {
    const now = new Date();
    const item = {
        value: value,
        expiry: now.getTime() + ttl,
    };
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(item));
};

const getItemWithExpiration = (key) => {
    const itemStr = localStorage.getItem(key);
    if (!itemStr) {
        return null;
    }
    const item = JSON.parse(itemStr);
    const now = new Date();
    if (now.getTime() > item.expiry) {
