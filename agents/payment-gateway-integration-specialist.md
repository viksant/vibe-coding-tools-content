  3. Use webhooks to handle subscription events (e.g., renewals, cancellations).
  
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
const createSubscription = async (customerId, planId) => {
  try {
    const subscription = await stripe.subscriptions.create({
      customer: customerId,
      items: [{ plan: planId }],
    });
    return subscription;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating subscription:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```
