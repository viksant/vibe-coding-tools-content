## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Ensuring proper RTL support involves a comprehensive understanding of CSS properties that affect layout and text direction. Key properties such as `direction`, `text-align`, and `float` need to be adjusted to accommodate RTL languages. For instance, using `direction: rtl;` on a container element ensures that all child elements inherit this property, which is crucial for text flow and layout orientation.

Additionally, frameworks like `rtlcss` automate the mirroring process by transforming standard CSS into RTL-compatible styles. This tool analyzes CSS files and generates a mirrored version, simplifying the development process. Understanding how to integrate such tools into the build process is essential for maintaining consistency across projects.

Another critical aspect is the handling of icons and images that may need to be mirrored. Using CSS properties like `transform: scaleX(-1);` can effectively flip icons, but it’s important to ensure that this does not affect the readability of text or other elements.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Neglecting Text Direction**: Failing to set `direction: rtl;` on key containers can lead to improper text flow.
2. **Inconsistent Icon Orientation**: Not mirroring icons can confuse users; always check for directional relevance.
3. **Ignoring Accessibility**: Overlooking ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility can hinder usability for visually impaired users.
4. **Hardcoding Styles**: Using fixed pixel values instead of responsive units can break layouts in RTL contexts.
5. **Not Testing on Multiple Browsers**: RTL rendering can differ across browsers; always validate across major platforms.
6. **Forgetting Form Input Handling**: Input fields must also respect text direction; ensure that placeholders and labels align correctly.
7. **Inadequate Documentation**: Failing to document RTL-specific styles can lead to confusion for future developers.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use `rtlcss` to automate CSS mirroring.
2. Always set `direction: rtl;` on parent containers for RTL languages.
3. Validate text alignment with `text-align: right;` for RTL text.
4. Mirror icons using CSS transformations when necessary.
5. Ensure form inputs have appropriate labels and placeholders aligned correctly.
6. Utilize ARIA roles and properties to enhance accessibility for RTL users.
7. Test layouts in various browsers and devices to catch inconsistencies.
8. Implement responsive design principles using relative units (e.g., `em`, `%`) instead of fixed units.
9. Maintain a consistent naming convention for CSS classes to avoid confusion.
10. Document all RTL-specific styles and components in your codebase.

### Performance Metrics
- **Rendering Speed**: Measure the time taken for RTL styles to load and render.
- **Accessibility Compliance Score**: Use tools like Axe or Lighthouse to assess accessibility.
- **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback specifically from RTL language speakers to identify usability issues.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Track rendering issues across different browsers and devices.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Set Direction Globally**: Always define `direction: rtl;` in the main CSS file for RTL languages.
2. **Use Logical Properties**: Prefer logical properties like `margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left` for better adaptability.
3. **Test with Real Content**: Always validate with actual RTL text to ensure proper display.
4. **Use Flexbox for Layouts**: Leverage Flexbox for responsive layouts that adapt to both LTR and RTL.
5. **Avoid Fixed Widths**: Use percentages or `auto` for widths to ensure flexibility in RTL layouts.
6. **Mirror Icons**: Use CSS transformations to flip icons that are direction-sensitive.
7. **Implement RTL-Specific Styles**: Maintain separate stylesheets or conditional logic for RTL-specific adjustments.
8. **Validate Accessibility**: Regularly check for compliance with WCAG guidelines for RTL interfaces.
9. **Utilize CSS Variables**: Define CSS variables for colors and spacing to maintain consistency across themes.
10. **Document Changes**: Clearly document any changes made for RTL support in your codebase.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern Example**: Avoid using `float: left;` for RTL layouts; use `float: right;` or Flexbox instead.
- **Pattern Example**: Use logical properties:
  ```css
  .container {
      direction: rtl;
      margin-inline-start: 20px; /* Instead of margin-left */
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **rtlcss Configuration**: Example of a basic `rtlcss` configuration:
  ```json
  {
      "options": {
          "processImport": true,
          "processUrl": true
      }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Responsive RTL Layout
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when designing a responsive web application that needs to support RTL languages.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set the `direction` property on the main container.
  2. Use Flexbox for layout management.
  3. Ensure all text elements have `text-align: right;`.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .responsive-container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: row-reverse; /* Reverse the order for RTL */
      direction: rtl;
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Mirrored Navigation
- **When to Apply**: Implement this pattern for navigation menus in RTL applications.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use Flexbox to align items.
  2. Ensure icons are mirrored.
- **Code Example**:
  ```css
  .nav {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: flex-end; /* Align to the right */
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Bidirectional Form Handling
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for forms that need to handle both LTR and RTL input.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set `direction` on input fields based on user selection.
  2. Ensure labels are aligned correctly.
- **Code Example**:
  ```html
  <input type="text" style="direction: rtl;" placeholder="أدخل النص هنا" />
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **User Experience**: Assess how intuitive the interface is for RTL users.
- **Performance**: Measure load times and rendering speeds for RTL styles.
