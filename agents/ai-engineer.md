## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Hybrid Search Implementation
**When to Apply**: Use when you need to combine vector similarity with keyword matching for improved retrieval accuracy.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define your search criteria and data sources.
2. Implement vector search using a database like Pinecone.
3. Integrate keyword matching using BM25.
4. Combine results and apply reranking strategies.

**Code Example**:
```python
from pinecone import Pinecone
from rank_bm25 import BM25

# Initialize Pinecone and BM25
pinecone.init(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
bm25 = BM25(corpus)

# Vector search
vector_results = pinecone.query(vector_query)

# Keyword search
keyword_results = bm25.get_top_n(query, n=10)

# Combine and rerank results
combined_results = combine_and_rerank(vector_results, keyword_results)
```

### Pattern Name: Multi-Agent Collaboration
**When to Apply**: Use when building systems that require multiple agents to work together on tasks.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define roles and responsibilities for each agent.
2. Use `LangChain` for managing workflows.
3. Implement communication protocols between agents.

**Code Example**:
```python
from langchain import Agent

# Define agents
agent1 = Agent(role='data_retriever')
agent2 = Agent(role='response_generator')

# Set up collaboration
agent1.set_next(agent2)
```

### Pattern Name: Real-Time Inference Optimization
**When to Apply**: Use when you need to optimize response times for user-facing applications.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Implement asynchronous processing using `FastAPI`.
2. Use caching strategies to store frequent queries.
3. Monitor performance and adjust configurations as needed.

**Code Example**:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/predict")
async def predict(input_data: str):
    cached_result = check_cache(input_data)
    if cached_result:
        return JSONResponse(content=cached_result)
    
    result = await model.predict(input_data)
    cache_result(input_data, result)
    return JSONResponse(content=result)
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure response times and accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the system can handle increased load.
- **Cost**: Evaluate operational costs against budget constraints.
- **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to legal and ethical standards.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Faster models may sacrifice accuracy; find the right balance.
- **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: More complex systems can be harder to maintain; simplify where possible.
- **Cost vs. Performance**: Higher-performing models often come with increased costs; evaluate ROI.

### Decision Trees
- **Choose A**: If low latency is critical and accuracy can be slightly compromised.
- **Choose B**: If accuracy is paramount and latency can be managed.
- **Choose C**: If budget constraints limit options; consider simpler models.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Option          | Cost | Performance | Scalability | Compliance |
|-----------------|------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Model A        | Low  | Medium      | High        | Yes        |
| Model B        | High | High        | Medium      | Yes        |
| Model C        | Medium | Low       | High        | No         |

## Advanced Techniques
