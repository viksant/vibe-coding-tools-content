## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding

JWTs offer a compact, URL-safe way to represent claims exchanged between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object, used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as plaintext in a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure. This allows for digital signing or integrity protection using a Message Authentication Code (MAC).

Refresh tokens are essential for maintaining user sessions without frequent re-authentication. By implementing refresh token rotation, a new refresh token is issued each time one is used, invalidating the old one and reducing the risk of replay attacks.

Sliding sessions create a better user experience by extending session duration based on user activity. This requires careful management of token expiration and renewal strategies to ensure tokens remain valid only while the user is engaged.

### Common Pitfalls

- **Not Rotating Refresh Tokens**: Skipping refresh token rotation can open up security vulnerabilities, allowing stolen tokens to be reused.
- **Improper Token Storage**: Storing tokens in insecure locations, like local storage, can leave them vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Ignoring Token Expiration**: Not setting appropriate expiration times for tokens can lead to unauthorized access.
- **Inadequate Revocation Mechanisms**: Without a solid mechanism to revoke tokens, applications may stay exposed to unauthorized access.
- **Overly Long Token Lifetimes**: Tokens with excessively long lifetimes increase the risk of misuse if compromised.
- **Neglecting Token Validation**: Inadequate server-side validation can allow unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **Using Weak Signing Algorithms**: Outdated or weak signing algorithms can compromise token integrity and security.

### Industry Best Practices

- **Implement Refresh Token Rotation**: Always issue a new refresh token when one is used and invalidate the old one to reduce replay risks.
- **Store Tokens Securely**: Use secure storage methods, like HttpOnly cookies, to protect tokens from XSS attacks.
- **Set Short Expiration Times**: Keep access tokens short-lived and refresh tokens longer-lived but enforce strict rotation policies.
- **Use Strong Signing Algorithms**: Opt for algorithms like RS256 over HS256 for signing tokens to improve security.
- **Implement Token Revocation Lists**: Maintain a list of revoked tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Monitor Token Usage**: Log and track token usage patterns to spot anomalies and potential threats.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always transmit tokens over secure channels (HTTPS) to safeguard against interception.
- **Limit Token Scope**: Grant only the minimum necessary permissions associated with tokens.
- **Educate Users**: Inform users about securing their sessions and tokens.
- **Regularly Review Security Practices**: Continuously assess and update security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.

### Performance Metrics

- **Token Expiration Rate**: Measure the percentage of tokens that expire without being used.
- **Refresh Token Usage Rate**: Track how often refresh tokens are used to assess user engagement.
- **Revocation Response Time**: Monitor the time taken to revoke a token to ensure it's no longer valid.
- **Replay Attack Incidents**: Keep an eye on detected replay attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of your security measures.
- **User Session Duration**: Analyze average session durations to understand user behavior and adjust token lifetimes accordingly.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles

1. **Always Rotate Refresh Tokens**: Issue a new refresh token every time one is used to minimize replay attack risks.
2. **Use Secure Storage**: Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies to prevent JavaScript access.
3. **Set Appropriate Expiration**: Define short expiration times for access tokens (e.g., 15 minutes) and longer for refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days).
4. **Implement Token Revocation**: Keep a revocation list to invalidate tokens when necessary.
5. **Validate Tokens on Every Request**: Ensure every request checks the token's validity and integrity.
6. **Use Strong Signing Algorithms**: Prefer asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RS256) for signing JWTs.
7. **Limit Token Scope**: Assign minimal permissions necessary for the token's intended use.
8. **Monitor Token Activity**: Log token usage and watch for unusual patterns.
9. **Educate Users on Security**: Provide guidance on securing their sessions and tokens.
10. **Regularly Rotate Signing Keys**: Change signing keys periodically to enhance security.
11. **Implement Sliding Sessions**: Extend session validity based on user activity for better user experience.
12. **Use HTTPS for All Communications**: Encrypt data in transit to protect tokens from interception.
13. **Review Security Practices Regularly**: Continuously evaluate and update security measures.
14. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Limit refresh token requests to reduce abuse.
15. **Test for Vulnerabilities**: Regularly conduct security assessments to identify and address weaknesses.

### Code Standards

- **Token Generation Example**:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function generateToken(user) {
    const payload = { id: user.id, role: user.role };
    const options = { expiresIn: '15m', algorithm: 'RS256' };
    return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, options);
}
```
- **Token Validation Example**:
```javascript
function validateToken(token) {
    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY);
        return decoded;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error('Invalid token');
    }
}
```
- **Refresh Token Rotation Example**:
```javascript
async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken) {
    const user = await findUserByRefreshToken(refreshToken);
    if (!user) throw new Error('Invalid refresh token');

    const newRefreshToken = generateRefreshToken(user);
    await saveRefreshToken(user.id, newRefreshToken); // Store new refresh token
    return { accessToken: generateAccessToken(user), refreshToken: newRefreshToken };
}
```

### Tool Configuration

- **jsonwebtoken Configuration**:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const options = {
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    expiresIn: '15m', // Access token expiration
};
```
- **jose Configuration**:
```javascript
const { JWK, JWT } = require('jose');
const key = JWK.asKey(process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, { alg: 'RS256' });
const token = JWT.sign({ id: user.id }, key, { expiresIn: '15m' });
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Refresh Token Rotation

- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern in applications where secure and long-lived user sessions are needed without frequent logins.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Generate a refresh token at user login.
  2. Store the refresh token securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie).
  3. Validate the refresh token upon access token expiration.
  4. If valid, issue a new access token and a new refresh token, invalidating the old one.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/refresh-token', async (req, res) => {
    const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;
    try {
        const user = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken);
        const newAccessToken = generateAccessToken(user);
        const newRefreshToken = generateRefreshToken(user);
        res.cookie('refreshToken', newRefreshToken, { httpOnly: true });
        res.json({ accessToken: newAccessToken });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    }
});
```

### Pattern Name: Sliding Sessions

- **When to Apply**: Best for applications with high user engagement, where users are likely to stay logged in for extended periods.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set a short expiration time for access tokens.
  2. Refresh the access token and extend the session based on user activity.
  3. Rotate the refresh token as well.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/activity', async (req, res) => {
    const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;
    try {
        const user = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken);
        const newAccessToken = generateAccessToken(user);
        res.json({ accessToken: newAccessToken });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    }
});
```

### Pattern Name: Token Revocation

- **When to Apply**: Use when a user logs out or when a token needs to be invalidated for security reasons.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Keep a revocation list in the database.
  2. Add tokens to the revocation list during logout.
  3. Check the revocation list during token validation.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
async function validateToken(token) {
    if (await isTokenRevoked(token)) {
        throw new Error('Token has been revoked');
    }
    return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY);
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Security**: Evaluate how secure the token management strategy is.
- **User Experience**: Consider how the approach affects user experience, particularly with session length and re-authentication.
- **Performance**: Look at the performance impact of token validation and rotation.
- **Scalability**: Think about how well the solution will scale as the user base grows.

### Trade-off Analysis

- **Short vs. Long Token Lifetimes**: Shorter lifetimes boost security but may frustrate users with frequent logins.
- **Token Rotation vs. Simplicity**: Rotation adds complexity but greatly enhances security.
- **Asymmetric vs. Symmetric Signing**: Asymmetric signing offers better security but may require more resources.

### Decision Trees

- **When to Use Refresh Token Rotation**: 
  - If security is paramount → Implement rotation.
  - If simplicity matters and security risks are acceptable → Consider static refresh tokens.
  
- **When to Use Sliding Sessions**:
  - If user engagement is high → Implement sliding sessions.
  - If security is a priority and user activity is unpredictable → Use fixed session durations.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices

| Approach                     | Cost (Complexity) | Benefit (Security) |
|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Refresh Token Rotation        | High              | Very High          |
| Static Refresh Tokens         | Low               | Medium             |
| Sliding Sessions              | Medium            | High               |
| Fixed Session Duration        | Low               | Medium             |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **PASETO (Platform-Agnostic Security Tokens)**: Consider PASETO for a more secure alternative to JWT, avoiding common JWT pitfalls.
2. **Token Binding**: Link tokens to specific client instances to reduce the risk of theft.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Add extra verification steps during token issuance for better security.
4. **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: Leverage OAuth 2.0 flows for managing token issuance and revocation.
5. **Audit Logging**: Keep detailed logs of token usage and revocation events to monitor for suspicious activity.
6. **Dynamic Token Scopes**: Adjust token scopes based on user behavior and context to limit risk.
7. **Cryptographic Token Storage**: Store tokens in encrypted formats to protect against unauthorized access.
