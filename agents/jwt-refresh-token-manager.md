## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
JWTs are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC). 

Refresh tokens are critical in maintaining user sessions without requiring the user to re-authenticate frequently. By implementing refresh token rotation, each time a refresh token is used, a new refresh token is issued, and the old one is invalidated. This significantly reduces the risk of token replay attacks, where an attacker could use a stolen refresh token to gain unauthorized access.

Sliding sessions allow for a more user-friendly experience by extending the session duration based on user activity. This requires careful management of token expiration and renewal strategies to ensure that tokens are only valid while the user is actively engaged.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Not Rotating Refresh Tokens**: Failing to implement refresh token rotation can lead to security vulnerabilities where stolen tokens can be reused indefinitely.
- **Improper Token Storage**: Storing tokens in insecure locations (e.g., local storage) can expose them to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Ignoring Token Expiration**: Not setting appropriate expiration times for access and refresh tokens can lead to prolonged unauthorized access.
- **Inadequate Revocation Mechanisms**: Lack of a robust mechanism to revoke refresh tokens can leave applications vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Overly Long Token Lifetimes**: Setting excessively long lifetimes for refresh tokens increases the risk of misuse if they are compromised.
- **Neglecting to Validate Tokens**: Failing to properly validate tokens on the server side can allow unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **Using Weak Signing Algorithms**: Employing outdated or weak algorithms for signing tokens can compromise their integrity and security.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Implement Refresh Token Rotation**: Always issue a new refresh token upon use and invalidate the old one to mitigate replay attacks.
- **Store Tokens Securely**: Use secure storage mechanisms, such as HttpOnly cookies, to protect tokens from XSS attacks.
- **Set Short Expiration Times**: Keep access tokens short-lived and refresh tokens longer-lived but with strict rotation policies.
- **Use Strong Signing Algorithms**: Prefer algorithms like RS256 over HS256 for signing tokens to enhance security.
- **Implement Token Revocation Lists**: Maintain a list of revoked tokens to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Monitor Token Usage**: Log and monitor token usage patterns to detect anomalies and potential attacks.
- **Use HTTPS**: Always transmit tokens over secure channels (HTTPS) to prevent interception.
- **Limit Token Scope**: Restrict the permissions associated with tokens to the minimum necessary for the application.
- **Educate Users**: Inform users about the importance of securing their sessions and tokens.
- **Regularly Review Security Practices**: Continuously assess and update security practices to adapt to emerging threats.

### Performance Metrics
- **Token Expiration Rate**: Measure the percentage of tokens that expire without being used.
- **Refresh Token Usage Rate**: Track how often refresh tokens are used to assess user engagement.
- **Revocation Response Time**: Measure the time taken to revoke a token and ensure it is no longer valid.
- **Replay Attack Incidents**: Monitor the number of detected replay attacks to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures.
- **User Session Duration**: Analyze average session durations to understand user behavior and optimize token lifetimes.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Rotate Refresh Tokens**: Issue a new refresh token upon each use to minimize replay attack risks.
2. **Use Secure Storage**: Store tokens in HttpOnly cookies to prevent access via JavaScript.
3. **Set Appropriate Expiration**: Define short expiration times for access tokens (e.g., 15 minutes) and longer for refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days).
4. **Implement Token Revocation**: Maintain a revocation list to invalidate tokens when necessary.
5. **Validate Tokens on Every Request**: Ensure every request checks the validity and integrity of the token.
6. **Use Strong Signing Algorithms**: Prefer asymmetric algorithms (e.g., RS256) for signing JWTs.
7. **Limit Token Scope**: Assign minimal permissions necessary for the token's intended use.
8. **Monitor Token Activity**: Log token usage and monitor for unusual patterns.
9. **Educate Users on Security**: Provide guidance on securing their sessions and tokens.
10. **Regularly Rotate Signing Keys**: Change signing keys periodically to enhance security.
11. **Implement Sliding Sessions**: Extend session validity based on user activity to improve user experience.
12. **Use HTTPS for All Communications**: Always encrypt data in transit to protect tokens from interception.
13. **Review Security Practices Regularly**: Continuously evaluate and update security measures.
14. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of refresh token requests to mitigate abuse.
15. **Test for Vulnerabilities**: Regularly conduct security assessments to identify and address potential weaknesses.

### Code Standards
- **Token Generation Example**:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function generateToken(user) {
    const payload = { id: user.id, role: user.role };
    const options = { expiresIn: '15m', algorithm: 'RS256' };
    return jwt.sign(payload, process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, options);
}
```
- **Token Validation Example**:
```javascript
function validateToken(token) {
    try {
        const decoded = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY);
        return decoded;
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error('Invalid token');
    }
}
```
- **Refresh Token Rotation Example**:
```javascript
async function refreshAccessToken(refreshToken) {
    const user = await findUserByRefreshToken(refreshToken);
    if (!user) throw new Error('Invalid refresh token');

    const newRefreshToken = generateRefreshToken(user);
    await saveRefreshToken(user.id, newRefreshToken); // Store new refresh token
    return { accessToken: generateAccessToken(user), refreshToken: newRefreshToken };
}
```

### Tool Configuration
- **jsonwebtoken Configuration**:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const options = {
    algorithm: 'RS256',
    expiresIn: '15m', // Access token expiration
};
```
- **jose Configuration**:
```javascript
const { JWK, JWT } = require('jose');
const key = JWK.asKey(process.env.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY, { alg: 'RS256' });
const token = JWT.sign({ id: user.id }, key, { expiresIn: '15m' });
```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Refresh Token Rotation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern in applications where user sessions need to be secure and long-lived without frequent logins.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Generate a refresh token when the user logs in.
  2. Store the refresh token securely (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie).
  3. On access token expiration, validate the refresh token.
  4. If valid, issue a new access token and a new refresh token, invalidating the old one.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/refresh-token', async (req, res) => {
    const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;
    try {
        const user = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken);
        const newAccessToken = generateAccessToken(user);
        const newRefreshToken = generateRefreshToken(user);
        res.cookie('refreshToken', newRefreshToken, { httpOnly: true });
        res.json({ accessToken: newAccessToken });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    }
});
```

### Pattern Name: Sliding Sessions
- **When to Apply**: Ideal for applications with high user engagement where users are expected to remain logged in for extended periods.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Set a short expiration time for access tokens.
  2. On user activity, refresh the access token and extend the session.
  3. Ensure that the refresh token is also rotated.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
app.post('/activity', async (req, res) => {
    const { refreshToken } = req.cookies;
    try {
        const user = await validateRefreshToken(refreshToken);
        const newAccessToken = generateAccessToken(user);
        res.json({ accessToken: newAccessToken });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
    }
});
```

### Pattern Name: Token Revocation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when a user logs out or when a token needs to be invalidated for security reasons.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Maintain a revocation list in the database.
  2. On logout, add the token to the revocation list.
  3. Check the revocation list during token validation.
- **Code Example**:
```javascript
async function validateToken(token) {
    if (await isTokenRevoked(token)) {
        throw new Error('Token has been revoked');
    }
    return jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_PUBLIC_KEY);
}
```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Security**: Assess the level of security provided by the token management strategy.
- **User Experience**: Evaluate how the approach impacts user experience, especially regarding session length and re-authentication.
- **Performance**: Measure the performance implications of token validation and rotation.
- **Scalability**: Consider how well the solution scales with an increasing number of users.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Short vs. Long Token Lifetimes**: Shorter lifetimes improve security but may frustrate users with frequent logins.
- **Token Rotation vs. Simplicity**: Implementing rotation adds complexity but significantly enhances security.
- **Asymmetric vs. Symmetric Signing**: Asymmetric signing provides better security but requires more resources.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use Refresh Token Rotation**: 
  - If security is a top priority → Implement rotation.
  - If simplicity is preferred and security risks are acceptable → Consider static refresh tokens.
  
- **When to Use Sliding Sessions**:
  - If users are highly engaged → Implement sliding sessions.
  - If security is paramount and user activity is unpredictable → Use fixed session durations.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach                     | Cost (Complexity) | Benefit (Security) |
|------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Refresh Token Rotation        | High              | Very High          |
| Static Refresh Tokens         | Low               | Medium             |
| Sliding Sessions              | Medium            | High               |
| Fixed Session Duration        | Low               | Medium             |
