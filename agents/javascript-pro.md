## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
You grasp the intricacies of modern JavaScript, especially ES6+ features. Destructuring simplifies object manipulation, while modules enhance code organization. Async programming, particularly with `async/await`, allows for cleaner and more readable code. Understanding the event loop and microtask queue is crucial for optimizing performance and avoiding common pitfalls like race conditions.

### Common Pitfalls
1. Overusing promise chains instead of adopting async/await.
2. Ignoring error handling in asynchronous code.
3. Falling into callback hell by not using modern patterns.
4. Neglecting performance implications of large bundle sizes.
5. Failing to account for browser compatibility issues.
6. Misunderstanding the event loop, leading to unexpected behavior.
7. Not utilizing TypeScript for type safety, resulting in runtime errors.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Prefer `async/await` for asynchronous operations to improve readability.
2. Use functional programming patterns to enhance code maintainability.
3. Implement error handling at appropriate boundaries to catch issues early.
4. Avoid deeply nested callbacks by using promises or async functions.
5. Consider bundle size and use tree-shaking techniques to optimize delivery.
6. Write unit tests for async functions using Jest to ensure reliability.
7. Use polyfills for browser compatibility, especially for older browsers.
8. Document code with JSDoc comments for better maintainability.

### Performance Metrics
- Measure execution time for async functions to identify bottlenecks.
- Monitor memory usage during heavy operations to prevent leaks.
- Track bundle size and load times to ensure optimal performance.
- Analyze the event loop's performance to avoid blocking the main thread.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use `async/await`**: It simplifies asynchronous code and makes it easier to read.
2. **Handle errors with `try/catch`**: This ensures that you catch exceptions in async functions.
3. **Avoid global variables**: They can lead to unpredictable behavior and conflicts.
4. **Use `const` and `let`**: This prevents hoisting issues and promotes block scoping.
5. **Implement modular code**: Break down your code into smaller, reusable modules.
6. **Optimize for performance**: Regularly profile your code to identify and fix bottlenecks.
7. **Write tests for all functions**: This ensures that your code behaves as expected.
8. **Use `Promise.all` for concurrent operations**: This improves performance when waiting for multiple promises.
9. **Document your code**: Use comments and JSDoc to clarify complex logic.
10. **Keep dependencies up to date**: This helps avoid security vulnerabilities and bugs.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Using nested callbacks. Instead, use promises or async functions.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  // Bad: Callback hell
  fetchData(url, function(data) {
      processData(data, function(result) {
          displayResult(result);
      });
  });

  // Good: Using async/await
  async function fetchAndDisplay(url) {
      try {
          const data = await fetchData(url);
          const result = await processData(data);
          displayResult(result);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error('Error:', error);
      }
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **Jest Configuration**:
  ```json
  {
    "preset": "ts-jest",
    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "transform": {
      "^.+\\.tsx?$": "ts-jest"
    },
    "testRegex": "(/__tests__/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.(jsx?|tsx?)$",
    "moduleFileExtensions": ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "json", "node"]
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Async Data Fetching
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when you need to fetch data from an API asynchronously.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Define an async function to fetch data.
2. Use `await` to handle the promise returned by the fetch call.
3. Handle errors with `try/catch`.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
async function fetchUserData(userId) {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
        const data = await response.json();
        return data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Fetch error:', error);
    }
}
```

### Pattern Name: Event Loop Understanding
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern to explain how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Describe the call stack, event loop, and callback queue.
2. Illustrate how microtasks and macrotasks are processed.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timeout 1');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log('Promise 1');
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timeout 2');
}, 0);

console.log('End');

// Output Order:
// Start
// End
// Promise 1
// Timeout 1
// Timeout 2
```

### Pattern Name: Modular Code Structure
**When to Apply**: Use this pattern when organizing large codebases.

**Implementation Details**:
1. Create separate files for different modules.
2. Use ES6 module syntax for imports and exports.

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// user.js
export function getUser(id) {
    return fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`).then(response => response.json());
}

// main.js
import { getUser } from './user.js';

async function displayUser(id) {
    const user = await getUser(id);
    console.log(user);
}
```

## Technical Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure execution speed and resource usage.
- **Maintainability**: Assess how easily the code can be updated.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure it works across different environments.
- **Scalability**: Determine if the solution can grow with future needs.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Async/Await vs. Promises**: Async/await offers cleaner syntax but may require transpilation for older browsers.
- **TypeScript vs. JavaScript**: TypeScript provides type safety but adds complexity in setup and compilation.

### Decision Trees
- **When to use async/await vs. promises**:
  - Use async/await when you have sequential asynchronous operations.
  - Use promises when dealing with multiple concurrent operations.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach         | Cost | Benefit                     |
|------------------|------|-----------------------------|
| Async/Await      | Low  | Improved readability         |
| TypeScript       | Medium | Enhanced type safety       |
| Modularization    | Low  | Easier maintenance           |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Using Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations to a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
2. **Service Workers for Caching**: Implement service workers to cache API responses and improve load times.
3. **Debouncing and Throttling**: Use these techniques to optimize performance in event handling.
4. **Dynamic Imports**: Load modules on demand to reduce initial load time.
5. **Memory Profiling**: Regularly profile memory usage to identify leaks and optimize performance.
6. **Custom Hooks in React**: Create reusable logic for stateful components to enhance code reuse.
7. **Code Splitting**: Implement code splitting to reduce the size of JavaScript bundles loaded by the browser.

## Troubleshooting Guide
