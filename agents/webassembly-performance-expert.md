## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
WebAssembly serves as a binary instruction format that allows for safe and efficient execution in the web environment. It enables developers to run code in languages like Rust and C++ at speeds close to native. Grasping WASM's architecture, including its stack-based virtual machine and execution model, is vital for effective optimization. Compiling high-level languages into WASM efficiently can greatly enhance performance, especially in applications that require heavy computation.

Memory management in WebAssembly is another key area. WASM operates with a linear memory model, which needs careful handling to prevent leaks and fragmentation. Techniques such as memory pooling and manual memory management can significantly boost performance.

Interoperability with JavaScript is crucial for taking full advantage of existing web technologies. This means knowing how to pass data between WASM and JavaScript, manage asynchronous calls, and handle exceptions effectively. Tools like Emscripten simplify this process, but understanding both languages is essential.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Neglecting Memory Management**: Not managing memory can lead to leaks and decreased performance.
- **Overusing JavaScript Interop**: Too many calls between WASM and JavaScript can slow things down.
- **Ignoring Profiling**: Not profiling your WASM modules can mean missing out on optimization opportunities.
- **Large Module Sizes**: Not optimizing for size can result in longer load times.
- **Inadequate Testing**: Failing to test WASM in different environments can cause unexpected issues.
- **Misunderstanding WASM Limitations**: Overestimating WASM's capabilities can lead to design flaws.
- **Not Leveraging Asynchronous Loading**: Loading synchronously can block the main thread and hurt user experience.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Profile Early and Often**: Use tools like Chrome DevTools to spot performance bottlenecks in your WASM.
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Implement memory pooling to minimize allocations.
- **Minimize JavaScript Calls**: Batch operations to limit interop calls and improve speed.
- **Use Streaming Compilation**: Compile WASM modules while they download to reduce latency.
- **Leverage SIMD**: Use Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) for parallel processing when possible.
- **Implement Lazy Loading**: Load WASM modules only when needed to speed up initial load times.
- **Utilize WASM-Specific Features**: Take advantage of features like threads and shared memory when applicable.
- **Keep Modules Small**: Use tools like `wasm-opt` to shrink your WASM binaries.
- **Test Across Browsers**: Make sure your application performs well on different browsers and devices.
- **Document Performance Metrics**: Keep clear records of performance benchmarks for future reference.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Track how long it takes to download and compile WASM modules.
- **Execution Time**: Measure how long specific functions in the WASM module take to run.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during execution to catch leaks.
- **FPS (Frames Per Second)**: For graphical applications, ensure you maintain a smooth frame rate.
- **Bundle Size**: Keep an eye on the size of the WASM binary and related assets.
- **Latency**: Measure delays caused by JavaScript interop calls.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Profile Before Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks first to avoid unnecessary changes.
2. **Use `wasm-opt` for Size Reduction**: This tool can greatly reduce the size of your WASM binaries.
3. **Implement Memory Pools**: Reuse memory allocations to prevent fragmentation and boost performance.
4. **Batch JavaScript Calls**: Cut down on the number of calls between WASM and JavaScript to lower overhead.
5. **Compile with Optimization Flags**: Use flags like `--release` in Rust to enable optimizations during compilation.
6. **Use Streaming Compilation**: Load and compile WASM modules as they download to enhance load times.
7. **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit global state usage to reduce complexity and bugs.
8. **Use Typed Arrays for Data Passing**: They offer better performance for transferring data between WASM and JavaScript.
9. **Test with Different Browsers**: Performance can vary across browsers, so ensure compatibility.
10. **Keep the WASM Module Stateless**: This simplifies debugging and can enhance performance.
11. **Leverage Emscripten's Features**: Use its built-in functions for memory management and interoperability.
12. **Document Performance Changes**: Keep track of how changes impact performance.
13. **Use `console.time` for Timing**: Measure function execution times to find slow spots.
14. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use developer tools in the browser to track memory consumption.
15. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep your libraries and tools current for performance boosts and security fixes.

### Code Standards
- **Use `const` and `let`**: Favor `const` for constants and `let` for variables to prevent hoisting issues.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Maintain readability by avoiding deep nesting of functions.
- **Comment Non-Obvious Code**: Add comments for complex logic to aid future developers.
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for functions and variables.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement try-catch blocks for error handling in interop calls.

### Tool Configuration
- **Emscripten Configuration**:
  ```bash
  emcc source.c -o output.wasm -O3 --closure 1
  ```
- **Wasmtime Configuration**:
  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "my_wasm_package"
  version = "0.1.0"
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Efficient Memory Management
- **When to Apply**: This pattern is useful when developing applications that require frequent memory allocations.
- **Implementation Details**: Set up a memory pool for efficient memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Code Example**:
  ```rust
  struct MemoryPool {
      pool: Vec<u8>,
      size: usize,
  }

  impl MemoryPool {
      fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
          MemoryPool { pool: vec![0; size], size }
      }

      fn allocate(&mut self, amount: usize) -> Option<&mut [u8]> {
          if amount <= self.size {
              let mem = &mut self.pool[..amount];
              self.size -= amount;
              Some(mem)
          } else {
              None
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Streaming Compilation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern for large WASM modules that can be compiled while downloading.
- **Implementation Details**: Utilize the `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` function for compilation during fetch.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('module.wasm');
  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response);
  ```

### Pattern Name: Lazy Loading of WASM Modules
- **When to Apply**: This is handy when WASM functionality isn't immediately required upon page load.
- **Implementation Details**: Load the WASM module only in response to specific user actions.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  let wasmInstance;

  async function loadWasm() {
      if (!wasmInstance) {
          const response = await fetch('module.wasm');
          const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response);
          wasmInstance = instance;
      }
      return wasmInstance;
  }
  ```

## Decision Framework
