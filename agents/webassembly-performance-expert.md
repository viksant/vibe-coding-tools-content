## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
WebAssembly is a binary instruction format designed for safe and efficient execution on the web. It allows developers to run code written in languages like Rust and C++ at near-native speed. Understanding the underlying architecture of WASM, including its stack-based virtual machine and the execution model, is crucial for effective optimization. The ability to compile high-level languages into WASM efficiently can drastically affect performance, especially in compute-heavy applications.

Memory management in WebAssembly is another critical area. WASM uses a linear memory model which requires careful handling to avoid memory leaks and fragmentation. Techniques like memory pooling and manual memory management can significantly enhance performance.

Interoperability with JavaScript is essential for leveraging existing web technologies. This involves understanding how to pass data between WASM and JavaScript, manage asynchronous calls, and handle exceptions effectively. The use of tools like Emscripten simplifies this process but requires a solid grasp of both languages.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Neglecting Memory Management**: Failing to manage memory can lead to leaks and performance degradation.
- **Overusing JavaScript Interop**: Excessive calls between WASM and JavaScript can introduce latency.
- **Ignoring Profiling**: Not profiling WASM modules can result in missed optimization opportunities.
- **Large Module Sizes**: Not optimizing for size can lead to longer load times.
- **Inadequate Testing**: Failing to test WASM in various environments can lead to unexpected behavior.
- **Misunderstanding WASM Limitations**: Overestimating the capabilities of WASM can lead to design flaws.
- **Not Leveraging Asynchronous Loading**: Synchronous loading can block the main thread, affecting user experience.

### Industry Best Practices
- **Profile Early and Often**: Use tools like Chrome DevTools to analyze performance bottlenecks in WASM.
- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Implement memory pooling and reuse strategies to minimize allocations.
- **Minimize JavaScript Calls**: Batch operations and minimize interop calls to enhance performance.
- **Use Streaming Compilation**: Load and compile WASM modules as they are downloaded to reduce latency.
- **Leverage SIMD**: Use Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) for parallel processing where applicable.
- **Implement Lazy Loading**: Load WASM modules only when needed to improve initial load times.
- **Utilize WASM-Specific Features**: Take advantage of features like threads and shared memory when applicable.
- **Keep Modules Small**: Use tools like `wasm-opt` to reduce the size of WASM binaries.
- **Test Across Browsers**: Ensure compatibility and performance across different browsers and devices.
- **Document Performance Metrics**: Maintain clear documentation of performance benchmarks for future reference.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Measure the time taken to download and compile WASM modules.
- **Execution Time**: Track the time taken for specific functions within the WASM module.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during execution to identify leaks.
- **FPS (Frames Per Second)**: For graphical applications, ensure a smooth frame rate.
- **Bundle Size**: Keep track of the size of the WASM binary and associated assets.
- **Latency**: Measure the delay introduced by JavaScript interop calls.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always Profile Before Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks before making changes to avoid unnecessary work.
2. **Use `wasm-opt` for Size Reduction**: This tool can significantly decrease the size of your WASM binaries.
3. **Implement Memory Pools**: Reuse memory allocations to avoid fragmentation and improve performance.
4. **Batch JavaScript Calls**: Reduce the number of calls between WASM and JavaScript to minimize overhead.
5. **Compile with Optimization Flags**: Use flags like `--release` in Rust to enable optimizations during compilation.
6. **Use Streaming Compilation**: Load WASM modules as they are being downloaded to improve load times.
7. **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit the use of global state to reduce complexity and potential bugs.
8. **Use Typed Arrays for Data Passing**: They provide better performance when passing data between WASM and JavaScript.
9. **Test with Different Browsers**: Performance can vary significantly across browsers; ensure compatibility.
10. **Keep the WASM Module Stateless**: This simplifies debugging and improves performance.
11. **Leverage Emscripten's Features**: Use Emscripten's built-in functions for memory management and interop.
12. **Document Performance Changes**: Keep track of changes and their impact on performance.
13. **Use `console.time` for Timing**: Measure execution time of functions to identify slow areas.
14. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Use browser developer tools to track memory consumption during execution.
15. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries and tools up to date for performance improvements and security fixes.

### Code Standards
- **Use `const` and `let`**: Prefer `const` for constants and `let` for variables to avoid hoisting issues.
- **Avoid Deep Nesting**: Keep code readable and maintainable by avoiding deep nesting of functions.
- **Comment Non-Obvious Code**: Provide inline comments for complex logic to aid future maintainers.
- **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive names for functions and variables.
- **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement try-catch blocks for error handling in interop calls.

### Tool Configuration
- **Emscripten Configuration**:
  ```bash
  emcc source.c -o output.wasm -O3 --closure 1
  ```
- **Wasmtime Configuration**:
  ```toml
  [package]
  name = "my_wasm_package"
  version = "0.1.0"
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Efficient Memory Management
- **When to Apply**: When developing compute-intensive applications that require frequent memory allocations.
- **Implementation Details**: Implement a memory pool to allocate and deallocate memory efficiently.
- **Code Example**:
  ```rust
  struct MemoryPool {
      pool: Vec<u8>,
      size: usize,
  }

  impl MemoryPool {
      fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
          MemoryPool { pool: vec![0; size], size }
      }

      fn allocate(&mut self, amount: usize) -> Option<&mut [u8]> {
          if amount <= self.size {
              let mem = &mut self.pool[..amount];
              self.size -= amount;
              Some(mem)
          } else {
              None
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Streaming Compilation
- **When to Apply**: For large WASM modules that can be compiled while being downloaded.
- **Implementation Details**: Use the `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` function to compile as the module is fetched.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch('module.wasm');
  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response);
  ```

### Pattern Name: Lazy Loading of WASM Modules
- **When to Apply**: When WASM functionality is not needed immediately on page load.
- **Implementation Details**: Load the WASM module only when a specific user action occurs.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  let wasmInstance;

  async function loadWasm() {
      if (!wasmInstance) {
          const response = await fetch('module.wasm');
          const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(response);
          wasmInstance = instance;
      }
      return wasmInstance;
  }
  ```
