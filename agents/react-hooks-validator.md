## Specialized Knowledge

### Technical Understanding
React hooks changed how we manage state and side effects in functional components. They enable developers to use state and other React features without needing to write a class. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` allow for a more functional approach to designing components. Knowing how hooks manage component lifecycle and state updates is vital for building effective applications.

Custom hooks are a fantastic feature that lets developers package logic and stateful behavior together, which promotes code reuse. A custom hook is simply a JavaScript function that starts with "use" and can call other hooks. This packaging helps reduce code duplication and enhances maintainability, especially in larger applications.

### Common Mistakes
1. **Breaking the Rules of Hooks**: Using hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions can lead to unpredictable behavior.
2. **Wrong Dependency Arrays**: Forgetting dependencies or including unnecessary ones in `useEffect` can result in stale closures or infinite loops.
3. **Overusing State**: Using state when local variables would work fine can lead to unwanted re-renders and slow down performance.
4. **Neglecting Cleanup in Effects**: Not returning a cleanup function in `useEffect` can result in memory leaks and strange behavior.
5. **Ignoring Type Safety**: Not effectively using TypeScript can lead to runtime errors that are tricky to debug.

### Best Practices
1. Follow the Rules of Hooks: Call hooks only at the top level and from React functions.
2. Use `useEffect` thoughtfully: Always specify dependencies to avoid stale closures and ensure effects run correctly.
3. Create custom hooks for shared logic: Encapsulate complex logic in custom hooks for better reusability.
4. Optimize performance: Use `React.memo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
5. Document custom hooks: Provide clear documentation and examples for any custom hooks.
6. Take advantage of TypeScript: Use TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety in hooks.
7. Test hooks thoroughly: Write unit tests for custom hooks to confirm they behave as expected.
8. Use React DevTools: Utilize React DevTools for profiling and debugging hooks behavior.
9. Keep hooks pure: Ensure custom hooks do not have side effects that impact the component lifecycle.
10. Monitor performance: Regularly profile your application to spot performance issues related to hooks.

### Performance Metrics
- **Re-render Count**: Track how often components re-render due to hook state changes.
- **Effect Execution Time**: Measure how long effects take to execute, particularly in `useEffect`.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption to catch potential leaks caused by hooks.
- **User Interaction Latency**: Check how responsive the UI is during state updates driven by hooks.

## Implementation Rules

### Key Principles
1. **Call Hooks at the Top Level**: This guarantees that hooks are called in the same order on every render, which is essential for React’s reconciliation process.
2. **Use Dependency Arrays in `useEffect`**: Always specify dependencies to avoid stale closures and ensure that effects run correctly.
3. **Return Cleanup Functions**: Always return cleanup functions from `useEffect` to prevent memory leaks.
4. **Avoid Inline Functions in JSX**: Use `useCallback` to memoize functions passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
5. **Use `useMemo` for Heavy Calculations**: Memoize expensive calculations to boost performance.
6. **Encapsulate Logic in Custom Hooks**: Create custom hooks for shared logic to encourage reusability and maintainability.
7. **Type Your Hooks**: Use TypeScript to define types for your hooks to catch errors early.
8. **Test Custom Hooks**: Write unit tests to make sure custom hooks behave as intended across different scenarios.
9. **Monitor Performance**: Use profiling tools to analyze the performance of hooks and identify bottlenecks.
10. **Document Hooks**: Provide clear documentation for custom hooks, including usage examples and edge cases.
11. **Avoid Side Effects in Render**: Ensure that hooks don’t cause side effects during the render phase.
12. **Use `useContext` for Global State**: Leverage `useContext` for managing global state more efficiently than prop drilling.
13. **Limit State Usage**: Use local variables instead of state when possible to reduce re-renders.
14. **Keep Custom Hooks Pure**: Ensure custom hooks don’t depend on external state or props that can change unexpectedly.
15. **Use `React.memo` for Component Optimization**: Wrap components in `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders when props remain unchanged.

### Code Standards
- **Example of an Anti-Pattern**: 
  ```javascript
  // Incorrect: Calling hooks conditionally
  if (condition) {
      const value = useState(0); // This violates the Rules of Hooks
  }
  ```
- **Correct Usage**:
  ```javascript
  // Correct: Always call hooks at the top level
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0);
  if (condition) {
      // Do something with value
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **ESLint Configuration for Hooks**:
  ```json
  {
      "rules": {
          "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error", // Checks rules of hooks
          "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" // Checks effect dependencies
      }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Custom Fetch Hook
- **When to Use**: When you need to fetch data from an API and handle loading and error states.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useFetch` that accepts a URL.
  2. Utilize `useState` to manage data, loading, and error states.
  3. Use `useEffect` to fetch data when the URL changes.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useFetch = (url) => {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
      const [error, setError] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
          const fetchData = async () => {
              try {
                  const response = await fetch(url);
                  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
                  const result = await response.json();
                  setData(result);
              } catch (error) {
                  setError(error);
              } finally {
                  setLoading(false);
              }
          };
          fetchData();
      }, [url]);

      return { data, loading, error };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Form Handling Hook
- **When to Use**: When managing form state and validation in a React component.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useForm` that manages form values and validation.
  2. Use `useState` to track form values and errors.
  3. Return handlers for input changes and form submission.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState } from 'react';

  const useForm = (initialValues) => {
      const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);
      const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

      const handleChange = (e) => {
          const { name, value } = e.target;
          setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
      };

      const validate = (validationSchema) => {
          const validationErrors = {};
          for (const key in values) {
              const error = validationSchema[key](values[key]);
              if (error) {
                  validationErrors[key] = error;
              }
          }
          setErrors(validationErrors);
          return Object.keys(validationErrors).length === 0;
      };

      return { values, errors, handleChange, validate };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Debounced Input Hook
- **When to Use**: When you want to delay processing of input changes to improve performance.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useDebounce` that takes a value and a delay.
  2. Use `useEffect` to set a timeout for updating the debounced value.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useDebounce = (value, delay) => {
      const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

      useEffect(() => {
          const handler = setTimeout(() => {
              setDebouncedValue(value);
          }, delay);

          return () => {
              clearTimeout(handler);
          };
      }, [value, delay]);

      return debouncedValue;
  };
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Consider how hooks affect rendering and state management.
- **Maintainability**: Think about how easily hooks can be reused and understood.
- **Type Safety**: Make sure hooks are type-safe to avoid runtime errors.
- **Complexity**: Reflect on how complex it is to implement and use hooks.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Custom Hooks vs. Component Logic**: Custom hooks encourage reusability but may add complexity if used excessively.
- **State Management Libraries vs. Hooks**: Libraries like Redux can centralize state management, but they may require more boilerplate compared to local hooks.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use a Custom Hook**:
  - If logic is reused across multiple components, consider creating a custom hook.
  - If the logic is specific to a single component, keep it within that component.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach               | Cost                         | Benefit                     |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Custom Hooks          | Increased complexity          | Code reuse and maintainability |
| State Management Library | Additional boilerplate      | Centralized state management |
| Local State Management | Simplicity                   | Easier to understand        |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Using `useReducer` for Complex State**: Use `useReducer` to manage complex state logic, especially when state depends on previous values.
2. **Memoizing Custom Hooks**: Apply `useMemo` to memoize results of custom hooks to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
3. **Creating a Hook for WebSocket Connections**: Build a custom hook to manage WebSocket connections, handling the connection lifecycle and message parsing.
4. **Integrating with Context API**: Use hooks along with the Context API to manage global state effectively without prop drilling.
5. **Implementing a Hook for Throttling**: Create a custom hook that throttles function calls, useful for managing events like scrolling or resizing.
6. **Using `useLayoutEffect` for DOM Manipulations**: Leverage `useLayoutEffect` for DOM measurements or manipulations before the browser repaints.
7. **Building a Hook for Local Storage**: Create a custom hook that syncs state with local storage, enabling persistent state across sessions.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Symptom**: Component re-renders too frequently.
   - **Cause**: An incorrect dependency array in `useEffect`.
   - **Solution**: Check and correct the dependency array to include only necessary dependencies.

   - **Solution**: Use functional updates in state setters or ensure dependencies are set correctly.

3. **Symptom**: Memory leaks in the application.
   - **Cause**: Not cleaning up effects in `useEffect`.
   - **Solution**: Return a cleanup function in `useEffect` to clean up subscriptions or timers.

4. **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in custom hooks.
   - **Cause**: Breaking the Rules of Hooks.
   - **Solution**: Make sure hooks are called at the top level and not conditionally.

5. **Symptom**: Performance issues during input handling.
   - **Cause**: Inline functions causing re-renders.
   - **Solution**: Use `useCallback` to memoize event handlers.

6. **Symptom**: Form validation not working correctly.
   - **Cause**: Incorrect validation schema or logic.
   - **Solution**: Debug the validation logic to ensure it accurately checks all fields.

7. **Symptom**: API calls not triggering on URL change.
   - **Cause**: Missing dependency in `useEffect`.
   - **Solution**: Add the URL to the dependency array in `useEffect`.
