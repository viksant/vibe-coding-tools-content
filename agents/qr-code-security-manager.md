## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
QR codes are handy for storing different types of data, but their security is crucial. You dive into the details of QR code encoding, analyzing how various encoding schemes impact both the size and security of the code. Understanding the implications of error correction levels (L, M, Q, H) is essential. Higher levels offer more resilience against damage but can make the code more complex.

You also look into vulnerabilities tied to QR codes, such as malicious payloads that could lead users to phishing sites or harmful downloads. Implementing validation measures to check the integrity of QR code content before processing is key to reducing these risks.

### Common Pitfalls
- **Neglecting Error Correction**: Skipping proper error correction can cause scanning issues, especially with low-quality prints.
- **Ignoring Payload Validation**: Failing to validate QR code content exposes users to security threats.
- **Static QR Codes**: Relying on static QR codes for sensitive information can result in security breaches; dynamic codes are a better choice.
- **Overlooking User Education**: Many users do not grasp the risks of scanning QR codes, which can lead to unsafe practices.
- **Inadequate Testing**: Not testing QR codes thoroughly across various devices and apps can create compatibility challenges.

### Industry Best Practices
- Always use **dynamic QR codes** for sensitive transactions to allow content updates.
- Apply **error correction levels** based on the use case and expected damage.
- Validate QR code content against known malicious patterns before processing.
- Educate users about scanning QR codes from trusted sources.
- Regularly update QR code generation libraries to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
- Integrate **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for QR code transactions.
- Use HTTPS links in QR codes for secure redirection.
- Monitor and log QR code scans to detect unusual activity.
- Test QR codes in different lighting conditions and at varying distances for reliability.
- Provide fallback options for users who can't scan QR codes.

### Performance Metrics
- **Scan Success Rate**: Measures the percentage of successful scans across different devices.
- **Error Rate**: Tracks the frequency of scanning errors due to poor quality or incorrect encoding.
- **User Engagement**: Looks at how often users interact with QR codes.
- **Security Incident Rate**: Counts the number of reported security incidents linked to QR codes.
- **Validation Time**: Notes the time taken to validate QR code content before taking action.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use Dynamic QR Codes**: Always choose dynamic QR codes for sensitive information to support real-time updates.
   - *Why*: This approach eliminates the need to reprint codes when information changes.
   
2. **Implement Error Correction**: Select an error correction level based on the environment where the QR code will be used.
   - *Why*: Higher error correction levels boost resilience against damage but may lower data capacity.

3. **Validate QR Code Content**: Always check the content of a QR code before executing any actions.
   - *Why*: This practice prevents malicious payloads from running.

4. **Educate Users**: Provide clear guidelines on safe QR code scanning practices.
   - *Why*: Raising user awareness is key to preventing security issues.

5. **Regularly Update Libraries**: Keep QR code generation and scanning libraries current.
   - *Why*: This helps protect against vulnerabilities in outdated code.

6. **Monitor Scanning Activity**: Log QR code scans to spot unusual patterns.
   - *Why*: This assists in identifying potential security threats.

7. **Use HTTPS Links**: Ensure all URLs in QR codes are HTTPS.
   - *Why*: This secures data transmission between the user and the destination.

8. **Test Across Devices**: Verify QR codes on various devices and scanning applications.
   - *Why*: Compatibility issues can lead to scanning failures.

9. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Offer alternative ways for users who cannot scan QR codes.
   - *Why*: This ensures accessibility for everyone.

10. **Implement 2FA**: For sensitive transactions, include two-factor authentication with QR codes.
    - *Why*: This adds an extra layer of security.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid using static QR codes for sensitive data.
  ```javascript
  // Avoid this
  const staticQRCode = generateQRCode("http://example.com/static-info");
  ```

- **Best Practice**: Go for dynamic QR codes.
  ```javascript
  // Preferred approach
  const dynamicQRCode = generateDynamicQRCode("http://example.com/dynamic-info");
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **qrcode.js Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  const qr = new QRCode(document.getElementById("qrcode"), {
    text: "http://example.com",
    width: 128,
    height: 128,
    correctLevel: QRCode.CorrectLevel.H, // High error correction
  });
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Dynamic QR Code for Event Registration
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when registration details may change.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a dynamic QR code linking to a registration page.
  2. Update registration details on the server as necessary.
  3. Monitor scan metrics to gauge interest.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const dynamicQRCode = generateDynamicQRCode("http://example.com/register?eventId=12345");
  ```

### Pattern Name: QR Code for Secure Payments
- **When to Apply**: Use for payment transactions that require user verification.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Generate a QR code linking to a payment gateway.
  2. Implement 2FA for confirming transactions.
  3. Log all transaction attempts for security audits.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const paymentQRCode = generateDynamicQRCode("https://paymentgateway.com/pay?amount=100&userId=abc");
  ```

### Pattern Name: QR Code for Product Authentication
- **When to Apply**: Use to verify the authenticity of products.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Generate a QR code linked to a product verification page.
  2. Update the product database with verification results.
  3. Inform users on how to scan and verify products.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const authQRCode = generateDynamicQRCode("http://example.com/verifyProduct?productId=XYZ");
  ```

## Decision Framework
