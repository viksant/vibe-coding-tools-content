## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Angular is a powerful framework that uses TypeScript to create dynamic web applications. A key element is its **component-based architecture**, which supports reusability and separation of concerns. Components communicate through inputs and outputs, ensuring clear data flow. Grasping the **Angular lifecycle hooks** is essential for managing component states effectively, especially when dealing with external services or APIs.

Another advanced concept is **state management** with NgRx, which applies the Redux pattern in Angular apps. This method centralizes application state, making it more predictable and easier to debug. By using **RxJS**, developers can handle asynchronous data streams efficiently. Mastering RxJS operators is crucial for managing and transforming these streams.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Change Detection Strategies**: Not optimizing change detection can create performance issues.
2. **Overusing Services**: Too many services can complicate the architecture and lead to tight coupling.
3. **Neglecting Unsubscription**: Forgetting to unsubscribe from observables can lead to memory leaks.
4. **Improper Use of NgRx**: Not following the unidirectional data flow can result in unpredictable states.
5. **Heavy Components**: Components that do too much can affect performance and maintainability.
6. **Lack of Lazy Loading**: Not using lazy loading for feature modules can increase initial load times.
7. **Ignoring Accessibility**: Overlooking accessibility can limit the user base and breach compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **OnPush change detection** for performance gains.
2. Implement **lazy loading** for feature modules to reduce initial load times.
3. Effectively utilize **RxJS operators** to manage asynchronous data.
4. Structure services to follow the **single responsibility principle**.
5. Use **Angular Material** for UI consistency.
6. Ensure proper **error handling** in HTTP requests.
7. Write unit tests for components and services with **Jasmine** and **Karma**.
8. Use **environment variables** for configuration management.
9. Optimize bundle size using **Angular CLI** configurations.
10. Document components and services for better maintainability.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Aim for under 2 seconds for the initial load.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Should be less than 5 seconds.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target under 1 second.
- **Bundle Size**: Keep the main bundle under 200 KB.
- **Change Detection Cycles**: Aim for fewer than 10 cycles per user interaction.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use OnPush Change Detection**: This reduces Angular's checks and boosts performance. Use it when the component relies only on input properties.
2. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Always lazy load feature modules to cut down the initial load time of the application.
3. **Unsubscribe from Observables**: Always unsubscribe in `ngOnDestroy` to avoid memory leaks. Consider using `takeUntil` with a subject for cleaner management.
4. **Follow the Redux Pattern with NgRx**: Manage all state changes through actions and reducers to keep the state predictable.
5. **Use Angular Material**: Take advantage of Angular Material components for a consistent and responsive UI.
6. **Optimize HTTP Requests**: Use `HttpClient` with proper error handling and retry strategies.
7. **Write Unit Tests**: Validate functionality and prevent regressions by ensuring all components and services have unit tests.
8. **Utilize Environment Files**: Store environment-specific configurations in environment files for better management.
9. **Minimize Component Complexity**: Each component should focus on a single responsibility to improve readability and maintainability.
10. **Use TrackBy in ngFor**: Implement `trackBy` to enhance list rendering by preventing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

### Code Standards
- **Component Structure**: Follow the Angular style guide for organizing components, services, and modules.
- **Service Naming**: Use the suffix `Service` for service classes (e.g., `UserService`).
- **Avoid Logic in Templates**: Keep templates clean by moving logic to the component class.
- **Use Async Pipe**: Prefer the `async` pipe in templates to manage subscriptions automatically.

### Tool Configuration
- **Angular CLI**: Create a new project with routing and SCSS using the following command:
  ```bash
  ng new my-app --routing --style=scss
  ```
- **RxJS Configuration**: Use `rxjs-compat` for backward compatibility when migrating from older versions.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: State Management with NgRx
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when your application handles complex state interactions that require predictable management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define actions for state changes.
  2. Create reducers to handle these actions.
  3. Set up selectors to access state.
  4. Use effects for side effects like API calls.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  // actions.ts
  export const loadUsers = createAction('[User] Load Users');
  
  // reducer.ts
  export const userReducer = createReducer(initialState, on(loadUsers, (state) => ({ ...state, loading: true })));
  
  // effects.ts
  @Injectable()
  export class UserEffects {
    loadUsers$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(loadUsers),
      mergeMap(() => this.userService.getAll().pipe(
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
        catchError(() => of(loadUsersFailure()))
      ))
    ));
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Lazy Loading Modules
- **When to Apply**: Use when you have feature modules that aren't needed at startup.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a feature module.
  2. Define routes for lazy loading.
  3. Use the `loadChildren` property in the routing module.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  const routes: Routes = [
    { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
  ];
  ```

### Pattern Name: Using the Async Pipe
- **When to Apply**: Use in templates to manage observables without manual subscriptions.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Declare an observable in the component.
  2. Use the async pipe in the template.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  // component.ts
  users$: Observable<User[]> = this.userService.getUsers();
  
  // component.html
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">{{ user.name }}</li>
  </ul>
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure load times and responsiveness.
- **Maintainability**: Assess code readability and modularity.
- **Scalability**: Check how well the architecture supports growth.
- **Testability**: Ensure components and services are easily testable.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **NgRx vs. Local State**: NgRx centralizes state management but adds complexity. Use local state for simpler components.
- **Performance vs. Readability**: Optimizations might reduce readability. Balance is essential.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use NgRx**: Choose NgRx for applications with complex state interactions. For simpler applications, local state may suffice.
- **Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading**: Opt for lazy loading for feature modules that aren't immediately needed to enhance initial load time.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach           | Cost (Complexity) | Benefit (Performance) |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| NgRx               | High              | High                  |
| Local State        | Low               | Medium                |
| Lazy Loading       | Medium            | High                  |
| Eager Loading      | Low               | Low                   |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Component Loading**: Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to load components dynamically based on user interactions.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement Angular Universal for better SEO and faster initial load times.
3. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features**: Take advantage of Angular's PWA capabilities for offline support and faster loading.
4. **Custom RxJS Operators**: Create custom operators to encapsulate complex logic and improve reusability.
5. **State Persistence**: Use local storage or session storage to persist state across sessions with NgRx.
6. **Performance Profiling**: Utilize Angular DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks.
7. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implement Angular's i18n features for multi-language support.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Slow Initial Load** → Large bundle size → Optimize with lazy loading and tree shaking.
2. **Memory Leaks** → Unsubscribed observables → Ensure all subscriptions are managed properly.
3. **Change Detection Issues** → Too many checks → Use the OnPush strategy where applicable.
4. **API Errors** → Incorrect endpoint or network issues → Verify API URLs and check network status.
5. **Component Not Rendering** → Missing module import → Ensure the module is imported in the parent module.
6. **State Not Updating** → Incorrect action dispatch → Check action types and reducer logic.
7. **Template Errors** → Undefined properties → Use the safe navigation operator (`?.`) in templates.
8. **Performance Bottlenecks** → Heavy components → Refactor to reduce complexity.
