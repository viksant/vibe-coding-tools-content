## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Angular is a powerful framework that leverages TypeScript to build dynamic web applications. A core concept is the **component-based architecture**, which promotes reusability and separation of concerns. Components interact through inputs and outputs, allowing for clear data flow. Understanding the **Angular lifecycle hooks** is crucial for managing component states effectively, especially when integrating with external services or APIs.

Another advanced concept is **state management** using NgRx, which implements the Redux pattern in Angular applications. This approach centralizes application state, making it predictable and easier to debug. Utilizing **RxJS** allows for reactive programming, enabling developers to work with asynchronous data streams efficiently. Mastery of RxJS operators is essential for transforming and managing these streams.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Ignoring Change Detection Strategies**: Not optimizing change detection can lead to performance bottlenecks.
2. **Overusing Services**: Creating too many services can complicate the architecture and lead to tight coupling.
3. **Neglecting Unsubscription**: Failing to unsubscribe from observables can cause memory leaks.
4. **Improper Use of NgRx**: Not following the unidirectional data flow can lead to unpredictable states.
5. **Heavy Components**: Creating components that do too much can hinder performance and maintainability.
6. **Lack of Lazy Loading**: Not implementing lazy loading for feature modules can increase initial load times.
7. **Ignoring Accessibility**: Failing to consider accessibility can limit the user base and violate compliance.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Use **OnPush change detection** strategy for performance optimization.
2. Implement **lazy loading** for feature modules to reduce initial load time.
3. Utilize **RxJS operators** effectively to manage asynchronous data streams.
4. Structure services to follow **single responsibility principle**.
5. Use **Angular Material** for consistent UI components.
6. Ensure proper **error handling** in HTTP requests.
7. Write unit tests for components and services using **Jasmine** and **Karma**.
8. Use **environment variables** for configuration management.
9. Optimize bundle size with **Angular CLI** configurations.
10. Document components and services thoroughly for maintainability.

### Performance Metrics
- **Load Time**: Aim for under 2 seconds for initial load.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Should be less than 5 seconds.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target under 1 second.
- **Bundle Size**: Keep under 200 KB for main bundle.
- **Change Detection Cycles**: Aim for fewer than 10 cycles per user interaction.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Use OnPush Change Detection**: This reduces the number of checks Angular performs, improving performance. It should be used when the component only relies on input properties.
2. **Implement Lazy Loading**: Always lazy load feature modules to decrease the initial load time of the application.
3. **Unsubscribe from Observables**: Always unsubscribe from subscriptions in `ngOnDestroy` to prevent memory leaks. Use `takeUntil` with a subject for cleaner management.
4. **Follow the Redux Pattern with NgRx**: Ensure that all state changes are managed through actions and reducers to maintain a predictable state.
5. **Use Angular Material**: Leverage Angular Material components for a consistent and responsive UI.
6. **Optimize HTTP Requests**: Use `HttpClient` with proper error handling and retry strategies.
7. **Write Unit Tests**: Ensure all components and services have unit tests to validate functionality and prevent regressions.
8. **Utilize Environment Files**: Store environment-specific configurations in environment files for better management.
9. **Minimize Component Complexity**: Each component should have a single responsibility to enhance readability and maintainability.
10. **Use TrackBy in ngFor**: Implement `trackBy` to optimize rendering of lists by preventing unnecessary DOM manipulations.

### Code Standards
- **Component Structure**: Follow the Angular style guide for organizing components, services, and modules.
- **Service Naming**: Use the suffix `Service` for service classes (e.g., `UserService`).
- **Avoid Logic in Templates**: Keep templates clean by moving logic to the component class.
- **Use Async Pipe**: Prefer `async` pipe in templates to manage subscriptions automatically.

### Tool Configuration
- **Angular CLI**: Use the following command to create a new project with routing and SCSS:
  ```bash
  ng new my-app --routing --style=scss
  ```
- **RxJS Configuration**: Use `rxjs-compat` for backward compatibility when migrating from older versions.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: State Management with NgRx
- **When to Apply**: Use when your application has complex state interactions that require predictable state management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Define actions for state changes.
  2. Create reducers to handle these actions.
  3. Set up selectors for accessing state.
  4. Use effects for side effects like API calls.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  // actions.ts
  export const loadUsers = createAction('[User] Load Users');
  
  // reducer.ts
  export const userReducer = createReducer(initialState, on(loadUsers, (state) => ({ ...state, loading: true })));
  
  // effects.ts
  @Injectable()
  export class UserEffects {
    loadUsers$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(loadUsers),
      mergeMap(() => this.userService.getAll().pipe(
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
        catchError(() => of(loadUsersFailure()))
      ))
    ));
  }
  ```

### Pattern Name: Lazy Loading Modules
- **When to Apply**: Use when you have feature modules that are not needed at startup.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a feature module.
  2. Define routes for lazy loading.
  3. Use the `loadChildren` property in the routing module.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  const routes: Routes = [
    { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
  ];
  ```

### Pattern Name: Using the Async Pipe
- **When to Apply**: Use in templates to handle observables without manual subscriptions.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Declare an observable in the component.
  2. Use the async pipe in the template.
- **Code Example**:
  ```typescript
  // component.ts
  users$: Observable<User[]> = this.userService.getUsers();
  
  // component.html
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">{{ user.name }}</li>
  </ul>
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure load times and responsiveness.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate code readability and modularity.
- **Scalability**: Assess how well the architecture supports growth.
- **Testability**: Ensure components and services are easily testable.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **NgRx vs. Local State**: NgRx provides a centralized state management solution but adds complexity. Use local state for simpler components.
- **Performance vs. Readability**: Optimizations may reduce readability. Balance is key.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use NgRx**: Choose NgRx for applications with complex state interactions. For simpler applications, consider using local component state.
- **Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading**: Use lazy loading for feature modules that are not immediately needed to improve initial load time.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach           | Cost (Complexity) | Benefit (Performance) |
|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| NgRx               | High              | High                  |
| Local State        | Low                | Medium                |
| Lazy Loading       | Medium            | High                  |
| Eager Loading      | Low               | Low                   |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Component Loading**: Use `ComponentFactoryResolver` to load components dynamically based on user interactions.
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Implement Angular Universal for better SEO and faster initial load times.
3. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Features**: Use Angular's PWA capabilities to enhance user experience with offline support and faster loading.
4. **Custom RxJS Operators**: Create custom operators to encapsulate complex logic and improve code reusability.
5. **State Persistence**: Use local storage or session storage to persist state across sessions with NgRx.
6. **Performance Profiling**: Utilize Angular DevTools for profiling and identifying performance bottlenecks.
7. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Implement Angular's i18n capabilities for multi-language support.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom → Cause → Solution
1. **Slow Initial Load** → Large bundle size → Optimize with lazy loading and tree shaking.
2. **Memory Leaks** → Unsubscribed observables → Ensure all subscriptions are properly managed.
3. **Change Detection Issues** → Too many checks → Use OnPush strategy where applicable.
4. **API Errors** → Incorrect endpoint or network issues → Verify API URLs and check network status.
5. **Component Not Rendering** → Missing module import → Ensure the module is imported in the parent module.
6. **State Not Updating** → Incorrect action dispatch → Check action types and reducer logic.
7. **Template Errors** → Undefined properties → Use safe navigation operator (`?.`) in templates.
8. **Performance Bottlenecks** → Heavy components → Refactor components to reduce complexity.
