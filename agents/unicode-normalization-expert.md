## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Unicode is a universal standard for character encoding, allowing text to be consistently represented across different languages and systems. Normalization converts text into a standard form, which is essential for accurate string comparison. The four main normalization forms‚ÄîNFC (Normalization Form C), NFD (Normalization Form D), NFKC (Normalization Form KC), and NFKD (Normalization Form KD)‚Äîeach serve unique purposes. Understanding these differences is key for effective text processing.

Character encoding conversions are another vital part of Unicode handling. Tools like `iconv-lite` and `chardet` are crucial for converting between different encodings and detecting the original encoding of text data. This is especially important for legacy systems or data from unknown sources, where encoding issues can lead to corruption.

Text sanitization prevents security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks. By normalizing and sanitizing input data, you ensure it is safe for processing and storage, which includes removing or escaping special characters to maintain expected formats.

### Common Pitfalls
- Not normalizing text before comparison, leading to incorrect results.
- Ignoring the different normalization forms, which can cause data inconsistencies.
- Mismanaging encoding detection, resulting in mojibake.
- Overlooking the need for sanitization, which exposes applications to security risks.
- Misusing libraries by applying incorrect normalization methods for specific cases.
- Assuming all text data is UTF-8 encoded without checking.
- Forgetting to handle emoji and special characters when processing text.

### Industry Best Practices
- Always normalize text data before comparing or storing it.
- Use NFC for canonicalization and NFKC for compatibility when needed.
- Implement robust encoding detection using `chardet` to avoid mojibake.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and corruption.
- Regularly update libraries for improvements and security patches.
- Use `iconv-lite` for reliable encoding conversions.
- Document encoding expectations and normalization practices in your codebase.
- Test applications with various character sets to ensure proper handling.
- Monitor performance impacts during text processing and optimize as needed.
- Leverage community resources for best practices in Unicode handling.

### Performance Metrics
- Measure string comparison accuracy rates after normalization.
- Track encoding detection success rates using tools like `chardet`.
- Calculate average processing time for normalization and encoding conversions.
- Monitor the frequency of mojibake in production environments.
- Assess security incident rates linked to text handling vulnerabilities.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Normalize Before Comparison**: Always normalize strings to a consistent form to avoid false negatives.
2. **Use Appropriate Normalization Forms**: Choose NFC for canonicalization and NFKC for compatibility based on the use case.
3. **Detect Encoding Before Processing**: Use `chardet` to identify incoming text data encoding to prevent mojibake.
4. **Sanitize User Inputs**: Implement input sanitization to remove or escape special characters and prevent injection attacks.
5. **Handle Emojis Properly**: Ensure your text processing logic accommodates emojis and special characters to avoid data loss.
6. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries like `unorm` and `iconv-lite` current to benefit from the latest features and fixes.
7. **Document Encoding Practices**: Clearly outline expected encodings and normalization practices in your codebase for future reference.
8. **Test with Diverse Data**: Regularly test your application with a variety of character sets to guarantee proper handling of all text inputs.
9. **Monitor Performance**: Keep track of text processing operation performance and optimize as necessary to avoid bottlenecks.
10. **Use Consistent Encoding**: Standardize on UTF-8 encoding for all text data whenever possible to reduce compatibility issues.

### Code Standards
- **Normalization Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize a string to NFC
  const normalizedString = unorm.nfc('caf√©');
  console.log(normalizedString); // Outputs: 'caf√©'
  ```

- **Encoding Conversion Example**:
  ```javascript
  const iconv = require('iconv-lite');

  // Convert from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8
  const buffer = Buffer.from('caf√©', 'latin1');
  const utf8String = iconv.decode(buffer, 'utf-8');
  console.log(utf8String); // Outputs: 'caf√©'
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **`unorm` Configuration**: No specific configuration needed; just require and use the library for normalization.
- **`iconv-lite` Configuration**: Make sure to specify the correct encoding during text conversion, e.g., `iconv.encode(text, 'utf-8')`.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Unicode Normalization for Database Storage
- **When to Apply**: When storing user-generated content in databases to ensure consistent retrieval.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Normalize the text to NFC before saving it to the database.
  2. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  3. Retrieve and normalize text to NFC when reading from the database.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize and save to database
  const userInput = 'caf√©';
  const normalizedInput = unorm.nfc(userInput);
  // Save normalizedInput to database...
  ```

### Pattern Name: Handling Emoji in User Inputs
- **When to Apply**: When accepting user inputs that may include emojis.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Normalize the input to NFKC for compatibility.
  2. Sanitize the input to remove any unwanted characters.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize and sanitize input
  const userInput = 'Hello üåç!';
  const sanitizedInput = unorm.nfkc(userInput);
  // Process sanitizedInput...
  ```

### Pattern Name: Encoding Detection for Legacy Data
- **When to Apply**: When processing legacy data that may have unknown or inconsistent encodings.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `chardet` to detect the encoding of the input data.
  2. Convert the detected encoding to UTF-8 for processing.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const chardet = require('chardet');
  const iconv = require('iconv-lite');

  // Detect encoding and convert
  const buffer = getLegacyData(); // Assume this fetches legacy data
  const encoding = chardet.detect(buffer);
  const utf8String = iconv.decode(buffer, encoding);
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: How well does the normalization process handle different character sets?
- **Performance**: What‚Äôs the processing time for normalization and encoding conversions?
- **Security**: Are there any vulnerabilities introduced by the text handling processes?
- **Compatibility**: Does the text processing work across different systems and platforms?

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Normalization vs. Performance**: Normalizing text can add processing overhead; balance the need for accuracy with performance requirements.
- **Encoding Detection vs. Reliability**: Relying on automatic encoding detection can introduce errors; consider manual specifications when possible.
- **Security vs. Usability**: Stricter sanitization may affect user experience; find a balance that maintains security without hindering usability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use NFC vs. NFKC**:
  - Use NFC for a canonical form needed for comparisons.
  - Use NFKC for compatibility with legacy systems or when storing data for processing by different applications.
