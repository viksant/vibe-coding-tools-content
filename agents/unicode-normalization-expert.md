## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Unicode is a universal character encoding standard that allows for consistent representation of text across different languages and systems. Normalization is the process of converting text to a canonical form, which is crucial for comparing strings accurately. There are four primary normalization forms: NFC (Normalization Form C), NFD (Normalization Form D), NFKC (Normalization Form KC), and NFKD (Normalization Form KD). Each form serves different purposes, such as compatibility and canonicalization, and understanding these differences is essential for effective text processing.

Character encoding conversions are another critical aspect of Unicode handling. Tools like `iconv-lite` and `chardet` are invaluable for converting between different encodings and detecting the original encoding of text data. This is particularly important when dealing with legacy systems or data from unknown sources, where encoding issues can lead to data corruption.

Text sanitization is vital for preventing security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks. By normalizing and sanitizing input data, we can ensure that it is safe for processing and storage. This includes removing or escaping special characters and ensuring that the text adheres to expected formats.

### Common Pitfalls
- Failing to normalize text before comparison, leading to incorrect results.
- Ignoring the implications of different normalization forms, resulting in data inconsistencies.
- Not handling encoding detection properly, which can lead to mojibake.
- Overlooking the need for sanitization, exposing applications to security risks.
- Misusing libraries, such as applying incorrect normalization methods for specific use cases.
- Assuming all text data is UTF-8 encoded without verification.
- Neglecting to account for emoji and special character handling in text processing.

### Industry Best Practices
- Always normalize text data before performing comparisons or storage.
- Use NFC for canonicalization and NFKC for compatibility when necessary.
- Implement robust encoding detection using `chardet` to avoid mojibake.
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- Regularly update libraries to leverage improvements and security patches.
- Utilize `iconv-lite` for reliable encoding conversions.
- Document encoding expectations and normalization practices in codebases.
- Test applications with diverse character sets to ensure proper handling.
- Monitor performance impacts of text processing and optimize where necessary.
- Leverage community resources and documentation for best practices in Unicode handling.

### Performance Metrics
- String comparison accuracy rates post-normalization.
- Encoding detection success rates using tools like `chardet`.
- Average processing time for text normalization and encoding conversions.
- Frequency of mojibake occurrences in production environments.
- Security incident rates related to text handling vulnerabilities.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Normalize Before Comparison**: Always normalize strings to a consistent form before comparing them to avoid false negatives.
2. **Use Appropriate Normalization Forms**: Choose NFC for canonicalization and NFKC for compatibility, depending on the use case.
3. **Detect Encoding Before Processing**: Use `chardet` to identify the encoding of incoming text data to prevent mojibake.
4. **Sanitize User Inputs**: Implement input sanitization to remove or escape special characters and prevent injection attacks.
5. **Handle Emojis Properly**: Ensure that your text processing logic accounts for emojis and special characters to avoid data loss.
6. **Regularly Update Dependencies**: Keep libraries like `unorm` and `iconv-lite` up to date to benefit from the latest features and security fixes.
7. **Document Encoding Practices**: Clearly document the expected encodings and normalization practices in your codebase for future reference.
8. **Test with Diverse Data**: Regularly test your application with a variety of character sets to ensure proper handling of all text inputs.
9. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the performance of text processing operations and optimize as necessary to avoid bottlenecks.
10. **Use Consistent Encoding**: Standardize on UTF-8 encoding for all text data whenever possible to minimize compatibility issues.

### Code Standards
- **Normalization Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize a string to NFC
  const normalizedString = unorm.nfc('caf√©');
  console.log(normalizedString); // Outputs: 'caf√©'
  ```

- **Encoding Conversion Example**:
  ```javascript
  const iconv = require('iconv-lite');

  // Convert from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8
  const buffer = Buffer.from('caf√©', 'latin1');
  const utf8String = iconv.decode(buffer, 'utf-8');
  console.log(utf8String); // Outputs: 'caf√©'
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **`unorm` Configuration**: No specific configuration needed; simply require and use the library for normalization.
- **`iconv-lite` Configuration**: Ensure to specify the correct encoding when converting text, e.g., `iconv.encode(text, 'utf-8')`.

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Unicode Normalization for Database Storage
- **When to Apply**: When storing user-generated content in databases to ensure consistent retrieval.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Normalize the text to NFC before saving to the database.
  2. Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  3. Retrieve and normalize text to NFC when reading from the database.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize and save to database
  const userInput = 'caf√©';
  const normalizedInput = unorm.nfc(userInput);
  // Save normalizedInput to database...
  ```

### Pattern Name: Handling Emoji in User Inputs
- **When to Apply**: When accepting user inputs that may include emojis.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Normalize the input to NFKC to ensure compatibility.
  2. Sanitize the input to remove any unwanted characters.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const unorm = require('unorm');

  // Normalize and sanitize input
  const userInput = 'Hello üåç!';
  const sanitizedInput = unorm.nfkc(userInput);
  // Process sanitizedInput...
  ```

### Pattern Name: Encoding Detection for Legacy Data
- **When to Apply**: When processing legacy data that may have unknown or inconsistent encodings.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `chardet` to detect the encoding of the input data.
  2. Convert the detected encoding to UTF-8 for processing.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  const chardet = require('chardet');
  const iconv = require('iconv-lite');

  // Detect encoding and convert
  const buffer = getLegacyData(); // Assume this fetches legacy data
  const encoding = chardet.detect(buffer);
  const utf8String = iconv.decode(buffer, encoding);
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: How accurately does the normalization process handle different character sets?
- **Performance**: What is the processing time for normalization and encoding conversions?
- **Security**: Are there any vulnerabilities introduced by the text handling processes?
- **Compatibility**: Does the text processing work across different systems and platforms?

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Normalization vs. Performance**: Normalizing text can add processing overhead; balance the need for accuracy with performance requirements.
- **Encoding Detection vs. Reliability**: Relying on automatic encoding detection can introduce errors; consider manual specifications where feasible.
- **Security vs. Usability**: Stricter sanitization may impact user experience; find a balance that maintains security without hindering usability.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use NFC vs. NFKC**:
  - Use NFC when you need a canonical form for comparisons.
  - Use NFKC when you need compatibility with legacy systems or when storing data that may be processed by different applications.
