## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
API mocking is a critical practice in modern software development, allowing teams to simulate backend services and focus on frontend development without waiting for API availability. Tools like **MockServer** and **WireMock** provide powerful capabilities for creating complex mock scenarios, including dynamic responses based on request parameters. Understanding how to leverage these tools effectively requires knowledge of HTTP protocols, response formats (like JSON), and the intricacies of request matching.

In addition, libraries such as **MSW** enable developers to intercept network requests at the service worker level, providing a seamless way to mock APIs in a browser environment. This is particularly useful for testing applications in real-world scenarios without the need for a live backend. Knowledge of how to configure these tools to handle edge cases, such as error responses and timeouts, is essential for creating robust testing environments.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Overly Simplistic Mocks**: Creating mocks that do not accurately reflect real API behavior can lead to false confidence in application stability.
2. **Ignoring Edge Cases**: Failing to simulate error scenarios or edge cases can result in unhandled exceptions in production.
3. **Static Responses**: Using static responses without considering dynamic data can limit the effectiveness of tests.
4. **Neglecting Versioning**: Not managing API versioning in mocks can lead to inconsistencies when the actual API changes.
5. **Lack of Documentation**: Poorly documented mocks can confuse team members and lead to misuse.
6. **Inadequate Integration Testing**: Relying solely on mocks without integrating with real APIs can miss critical integration issues.
7. **Not Using CI/CD**: Failing to integrate mocks into CI/CD pipelines can lead to undetected issues in development.

   - *Why*: This allows testing of error handling in applications.

6. **Document Mocks Thoroughly**: Provide detailed documentation for each mock endpoint.
   - *Why*: Clear documentation aids team members in understanding and using mocks correctly.

7. **Integrate Mocks in CI/CD**: Ensure mocks are part of the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing.
   - *Why*: This ensures that tests are run consistently and issues are caught early.

8. **Use Service Workers for Frontend**: Implement **MSW** for intercepting requests in frontend applications.
   - *Why*: This allows for seamless testing without modifying the application code.

9. **Monitor Mock Performance**: Track response times and error rates for mocks.
   - *Why*: Monitoring helps in identifying performance bottlenecks.

10. **Collaborate with Teams**: Regularly communicate with frontend and backend teams regarding mock updates.
    - *Why*: Collaboration ensures that mocks remain relevant and useful.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-Pattern**: Using hardcoded responses without considering variations.
  ```javascript
  // Anti-pattern example
  const mockResponse = { id: 1, name: "John Doe" }; // Static response
  ```
- **Best Practice**: Implementing dynamic responses based on request parameters.
  ```javascript
  // Best practice example
  app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
      const userId = req.params.id;
      const mockResponse = { id: userId, name: "User " + userId }; // Dynamic response
      res.json(mockResponse);
  });
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- **MockServer Configuration Example**:
  ```json
  {
      "httpRequest": {
          "method": "GET",
          "path": "/api/users"
      },
      "httpResponse": {
          "statusCode": 200,
          "body": "[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"John Doe\"},{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"Jane Doe\"}]",
          "headers": {
              "Content-Type": "application/json"
          }
      }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Dynamic User Response
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when simulating user data retrieval in a frontend application.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Define a route for user data.
  2. Use request parameters to generate user-specific responses.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
      const users = [{ id: 1, name: "John Doe" }, { id: 2, name: "Jane Doe" }];
      const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
      res.json(user || { error: "User not found" });
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Error Simulation
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern to test how applications handle API errors.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Create a mock route that returns various HTTP error codes.
  2. Ensure the application correctly handles these errors.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/error', (req, res) => {
      res.status(500).json({ error: "Internal Server Error" });
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Conditional Responses
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when the response needs to vary based on input conditions.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Check request parameters.
  2. Return different responses based on the conditions.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/items', (req, res) => {
      if (req.query.type === 'premium') {
          res.json([{ id: 1, name: "Premium Item" }]);
      } else {
          res.json([{ id: 2, name: "Standard Item" }]);
      }
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Delayed Responses
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern to simulate network latency in API responses.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Introduce a delay before sending the response.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/delayed', (req, res) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
          res.json({ message: "This response was delayed" });
      }, 2000); // 2 seconds delay
  });
  ```

### Pattern Name: Mocking Third-Party APIs
- **When to Apply**: Use this pattern when integrating with third-party APIs that may not always be available.
- **Implementation Details**: 
  1. Create mocks that simulate the behavior of the third-party API.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/third-party', (req, res) => {
      res.json({ data: "Mocked data from third-party API" });
  });
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Response Accuracy**: How closely does the mock response match the expected real API response?
- **Performance**: What is the response time of the mock server?
- **Integration Ease**: How easily can the mock be integrated into existing workflows?
- **Maintenance Overhead**: What is the effort required to maintain the mock as the API evolves?

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Static vs. Dynamic Mocks**: Static mocks are easier to set up but may not reflect real-world scenarios. Dynamic mocks require more effort but provide better accuracy.
- **Local vs. Remote Mocks**: Local mocks are faster and more reliable but may not account for network-related issues. Remote mocks simulate real-world conditions but can introduce latency.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use MockServer vs. WireMock**:
  - Use **MockServer** for complex request matching and dynamic responses.
  - Use **WireMock** for simpler setups and when needing to simulate HTTP interactions easily.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach                | Cost (Time/Resources) | Benefit (Accuracy/Performance) |
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Static Mocks           | Low                   | Medium                         |
| Dynamic Mocks          | High                  | High                           |
| Local Mocks            | Low                   | Medium                         |
| Remote Mocks           | Medium                | High                           |
