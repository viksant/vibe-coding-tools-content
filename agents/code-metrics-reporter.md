      "browser": true,
      "es6": true
    },
    "extends": "eslint:recommended",
    "rules": {
      "no-console": "warn",
      "indent": ["error", 2],
      "quotes": ["error", "single"],
      "semi": ["error", "always"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Stylelint Configuration Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "extends": "stylelint-config-standard",
    "rules": {
      "color-no-invalid-hex": true,
      "declaration-colon-space-after": "always",
      "block-no-empty": true
    }
  }
  ```

### Tool Configuration

- **SonarQube Settings**: Configure the following for optimal performance:
  - **Quality Gate**: Set it to fail builds if any critical issues appear.
  - **Branch Analysis**: Enable for all feature branches.
  - **Notifications**: Set up email alerts for quality gate failures.
