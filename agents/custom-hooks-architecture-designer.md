## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Custom hooks in React allow developers to reuse stateful logic across components, which leads to cleaner code and clearer separation of concerns. It's essential to grasp the lifecycle of hooks; they run in the order they’re called. Any conditional logic around hooks can break the rules of hooks. Concepts like **hook factories** and **useReducer** for managing complex state are vital for building strong applications.

Managing dependencies in hooks is also key. Using `useEffect` properly to handle side effects requires a solid understanding of dependency arrays. This knowledge helps avoid unnecessary re-renders and keeps performance optimal. Plus, using TypeScript with hooks boosts type safety, enhancing tooling and error checking during development.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Conditional Hook Calls**: Calling hooks conditionally can create unpredictable behavior and violate the rules of hooks.
2. **Incorrect Dependency Arrays**: Missing dependencies in `useEffect` can lead to stale closures, while adding unnecessary dependencies can cause excessive re-renders.
3. **State Management Misuse**: Incorrect use of `useState` can lead to performance issues and bugs.
4. **Over-Engineering Hooks**: Complex hooks can hurt readability and reusability.
5. **Not Leveraging Memoization**: Skipping `useMemo` or `useCallback` can hurt performance in components that rely on custom hooks.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Always follow the **rules of hooks** to prevent issues.
2. Use **TypeScript** for type safety in hook parameters and return values.
3. Create **hook libraries** for shared logic across projects to boost reusability.
4. Implement **unit tests** for custom hooks to ensure reliability.
5. Use **memoization** techniques to enhance performance when using hooks.
6. Keep hooks **pure** and free from side effects for predictability.
7. Document hooks thoroughly to help other developers understand their usage.
8. Use **custom hooks** to encapsulate complex logic and keep components clean.
9. Regularly refactor hooks to improve clarity and reduce complexity.
10. Monitor performance metrics to identify and address bottlenecks in hook usage.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Track the time it takes for components using hooks to render.
- **Re-render Count**: Monitor how often components re-render due to hook state changes.
- **Memory Usage**: Check memory consumption to spot potential leaks related to hooks.
- **Custom Hook Execution Time**: Benchmark the execution time of custom hooks to ensure they run efficiently.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always call hooks at the top level** of your React function components to avoid issues with the rules of hooks.
2. **Use dependency arrays** in `useEffect` and `useMemo` to control when effects run and values are recalculated.
3. **Return values from hooks** should remain consistent across renders to prevent unexpected behavior.
4. **Encapsulate complex logic** in custom hooks to keep components focused on rendering.
5. **Avoid side effects** in custom hooks; use `useEffect` for those instead.
6. **Use TypeScript** to define hook input and output types for a better developer experience.
7. **Document custom hooks** with usage examples and expected behavior.
8. **Test custom hooks** with frameworks like React Testing Library to ensure they behave as expected.
9. **Use `useReducer`** for managing complex state logic within hooks.
10. **Leverage context** to share state across hooks when needed, avoiding prop drilling.
11. **Implement error boundaries** around components using hooks to handle errors gracefully.
12. **Optimize performance** by using `React.memo` for components that use hooks.
13. **Avoid using hooks in class components** since they aren't supported.
14. **Keep hooks focused** on a single responsibility to boost reusability.
15. **Refactor hooks regularly** to keep them aligned with best practices and performance improvements.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Calling hooks conditionally
  ```javascript
  if (someCondition) {
    const value = useCustomHook(); // This is a violation
  }
  ```
- **Best Practice**: Always call hooks unconditionally
  ```javascript
  const value = useCustomHook(); // Correct usage
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- For TypeScript, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "jsx": "react",
      "esModuleInterop": true
    }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Use of Custom Hook for Form Handling
- **When to Apply**: When creating forms that require validation and state management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useForm` that manages form state.
  2. Use `useState` for input values and `useEffect` for validation.
  3. Return handlers for input changes and form submission.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useForm = (initialValues) => {
    const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

    const handleChange = (e) => {
      const { name, value } = e.target;
      setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
    };

    const validate = () => {
      // validation logic
    };

    useEffect(() => {
      validate();
    }, [values]);

    return { values, errors, handleChange };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Hook Composition for Data Fetching
- **When to Apply**: When multiple components need to fetch and share data.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useFetch` that handles API calls.
  2. Use this hook in multiple components to fetch data.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useFetch = (url) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
      const fetchData = async () => {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      };

      fetchData();
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Managing State with `useReducer`
- **When to Apply**: For complex state logic in forms or multi-step processes.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `useReducer` to manage state transitions.
  2. Define action types and a reducer function.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useReducer } from 'react';

  const initialState = { count: 0 };

  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  const useCounter = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return { state, dispatch };
  };
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Assess render times and re-render counts.
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate the complexity of hooks and their documentation.
- **Reusability**: Determine how easily hooks can be reused across components.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Custom Hooks vs. Component Logic**: Custom hooks can encapsulate logic but may add complexity if overused.
- **Using `useState` vs. `useReducer`**: `useState` is simpler for basic state, while `useReducer` suits complex state management better.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use a Custom Hook**:
  - If the logic is reused across multiple components → Create a custom hook.
  - If the logic is specific to one component → Keep it within the component.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach              | Cost                       | Benefit                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Custom Hook          | Initial development time   | High reusability                |
| Using Context        | Complexity in setup        | Avoids prop drilling            |
| Using `useReducer`   | Learning curve             | Better state management         |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Hook Creation**: Create hooks that accept parameters to adjust their behavior based on input, enhancing flexibility.
2. **Performance Profiling**: Use React's profiling tools to analyze hook performance and optimize based on findings.
3. **Custom Hook Libraries**: Develop a library of reusable hooks to share across projects, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.
4. **Error Handling in Hooks**: Build robust error handling within custom hooks to gracefully manage API failures.
5. **Using `useLayoutEffect`**: Use `useLayoutEffect` for synchronous re-rendering after DOM mutations to maintain visual consistency.
6. **React Query Integration**: Combine libraries like React Query with custom hooks for effective data fetching and caching management.
7. **Testing with Mocking**: Use mocking libraries to test custom hooks in isolation, ensuring they function correctly under various scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- **Symptom**: Hook violation error
  - **Cause**: Hooks are called conditionally.
  - **Solution**: Ensure hooks are called at the top level of the component.

- **Symptom**: Stale state in `useEffect`
  - **Cause**: Missing dependencies in the dependency array.
  - **Solution**: Review and add necessary dependencies.

- **Symptom**: Performance issues in components
  - **Cause**: Excessive re-renders from state updates.
  - **Solution**: Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize values and functions.

- **Symptom**: API call fails
  - **Cause**: Incorrect URL or network issues.
  - **Solution**: Verify the API endpoint and check the network status.

- **Symptom**: Form validation not triggering
  - **Cause**: Validation logic not executed.
  - **Solution**: Ensure validation runs in the appropriate lifecycle method.

- **Symptom**: Memory leaks in hooks
  - **Cause**: Not cleaning up subscriptions or event listeners.
