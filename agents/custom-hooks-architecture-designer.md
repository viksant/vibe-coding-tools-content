## Specialized Knowledge

### Deep Technical Understanding
Custom hooks in React allow developers to extract and reuse stateful logic across components, promoting cleaner code and better separation of concerns. Understanding the lifecycle of hooks is crucial; they run in the order they are called, which means that any conditional logic around hooks can lead to violations of the rules of hooks. Advanced concepts such as **hook factories** and **useReducer** for complex state management are essential for building robust applications.

Moreover, managing dependencies in hooks is vital. Using `useEffect` correctly to handle side effects requires a deep understanding of dependency arrays to avoid unnecessary re-renders and ensure optimal performance. Additionally, leveraging TypeScript with hooks enhances type safety, allowing for better tooling and error checking during development.

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Conditional Hook Calls**: Calling hooks conditionally can lead to unpredictable behavior and violate the rules of hooks.
2. **Incorrect Dependency Arrays**: Omitting dependencies in `useEffect` can cause stale closures, while including unnecessary dependencies can lead to excessive re-renders.
3. **State Management Misuse**: Using `useState` incorrectly can lead to performance issues and bugs in state updates.
4. **Over-Engineering Hooks**: Creating overly complex hooks can reduce readability and reusability.
5. **Not Leveraging Memoization**: Failing to use `useMemo` or `useCallback` can lead to performance degradation in components that rely on custom hooks.

### Industry Best Practices
1. Always follow the **rules of hooks** to prevent violations.
2. Use **TypeScript** for type safety in hook parameters and return values.
3. Create **hook libraries** for shared logic across projects to enhance reusability.
4. Implement **unit tests** for custom hooks to ensure reliability and maintainability.
5. Use **memoization** techniques to optimize performance when using hooks.
6. Keep hooks **pure** and free from side effects to maintain predictability.
7. Document hooks thoroughly to aid other developers in understanding their usage.
8. Use **custom hooks** to encapsulate complex logic and keep components clean.
9. Regularly refactor hooks to improve clarity and reduce complexity.
10. Monitor performance metrics to identify and address bottlenecks in hook usage.

### Performance Metrics
- **Render Time**: Measure the time taken for components using hooks to render.
- **Re-render Count**: Track how often components re-render due to hook state changes.
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption to identify potential leaks related to hooks.
- **Custom Hook Execution Time**: Benchmark the execution time of custom hooks to ensure efficiency.

## Implementation Rules

### Must-Follow Principles
1. **Always call hooks at the top level** of your React function components to avoid breaking the rules of hooks.
2. **Use dependency arrays** in `useEffect` and `useMemo` to control when effects run and values are recalculated.
3. **Return values from hooks** should be consistent across renders to avoid unexpected behavior.
4. **Encapsulate complex logic** in custom hooks to keep components focused on rendering.
5. **Avoid side effects** in custom hooks; use `useEffect` for side effects instead.
6. **Use TypeScript** to define hook input and output types for better developer experience.
7. **Document custom hooks** with usage examples and expected behavior.
8. **Test custom hooks** with frameworks like React Testing Library to ensure they behave as expected.
9. **Use `useReducer`** for managing complex state logic within hooks.
10. **Leverage context** to share state across hooks when necessary, avoiding prop drilling.
11. **Implement error boundaries** around components using hooks to gracefully handle errors.
12. **Optimize performance** by using `React.memo` for components that use hooks.
13. **Avoid using hooks in class components** as they are not supported.
14. **Keep hooks focused** on a single responsibility to enhance reusability.
15. **Refactor hooks regularly** to keep them up to date with best practices and performance improvements.

### Code Standards
- **Anti-pattern**: Calling hooks conditionally
  ```javascript
  if (someCondition) {
    const value = useCustomHook(); // This is a violation
  }
  ```
- **Best Practice**: Always call hooks unconditionally
  ```javascript
  const value = useCustomHook(); // Correct usage
  ```

### Tool Configuration
- For TypeScript, ensure your `tsconfig.json` includes:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "jsx": "react",
      "esModuleInterop": true
    }
  }
  ```

## Real-World Patterns

### Pattern Name: Use of Custom Hook for Form Handling
- **When to Apply**: When building forms that require validation and state management.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useForm` that manages form state.
  2. Use `useState` for input values and `useEffect` for validation.
  3. Return handlers for input changes and form submission.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useForm = (initialValues) => {
    const [values, setValues] = useState(initialValues);
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState({});

    const handleChange = (e) => {
      const { name, value } = e.target;
      setValues({ ...values, [name]: value });
    };

    const validate = () => {
      // validation logic
    };

    useEffect(() => {
      validate();
    }, [values]);

    return { values, errors, handleChange };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Hook Composition for Data Fetching
- **When to Apply**: When multiple components need to fetch and share data.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Create a custom hook `useFetch` that handles API calls.
  2. Use this hook in multiple components to fetch data.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

  const useFetch = (url) => {
    const [data, setData] = useState(null);
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

    useEffect(() => {
      const fetchData = async () => {
        const response = await fetch(url);
        const result = await response.json();
        setData(result);
        setLoading(false);
      };

      fetchData();
    }, [url]);

    return { data, loading };
  };
  ```

### Pattern Name: Managing State with `useReducer`
- **When to Apply**: For complex state logic in forms or multi-step processes.
- **Implementation Details**:
  1. Use `useReducer` to manage state transitions.
  2. Define action types and a reducer function.
- **Code Example**:
  ```javascript
  import { useReducer } from 'react';

  const initialState = { count: 0 };

  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment':
        return { count: state.count + 1 };
      case 'decrement':
        return { count: state.count - 1 };
      default:
        return state;
    }
  };

  const useCounter = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return { state, dispatch };
  };
  ```

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Performance**: Measure render times and re-render counts.
- **Maintainability**: Assess the complexity of hooks and their documentation.
- **Reusability**: Determine how easily hooks can be reused across components.

### Trade-off Analysis
- **Custom Hooks vs. Component Logic**: Custom hooks can encapsulate logic but may introduce complexity if overused.
- **Using `useState` vs. `useReducer`**: `useState` is simpler for basic state, while `useReducer` is better for complex state management.

### Decision Trees
- **When to Use a Custom Hook**:
  - If the logic is reused across multiple components → Create a custom hook.
  - If the logic is specific to one component → Keep it within the component.

### Cost-Benefit Matrices
| Approach              | Cost                       | Benefit                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Custom Hook          | Initial development time   | High reusability                |
| Using Context        | Complexity in setup        | Avoids prop drilling            |
| Using `useReducer`   | Learning curve             | Better state management         |

## Advanced Techniques

1. **Dynamic Hook Creation**: Create hooks that can accept parameters to dynamically adjust their behavior based on input, enhancing flexibility.
2. **Performance Profiling**: Use React's built-in profiling tools to analyze the performance of hooks and optimize them based on findings.
3. **Custom Hook Libraries**: Develop a library of reusable hooks that can be shared across projects, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.
4. **Error Handling in Hooks**: Implement robust error handling within custom hooks to manage API failures gracefully.
5. **Using `useLayoutEffect`**: Leverage `useLayoutEffect` for synchronously re-rendering components after DOM mutations, ensuring visual consistency.
6. **React Query Integration**: Use libraries like React Query to manage server state and caching in conjunction with custom hooks for data fetching.
7. **Testing with Mocking**: Utilize mocking libraries to test custom hooks in isolation, ensuring they behave correctly under various scenarios.

## Troubleshooting Guide

- **Symptom**: Hook violation error
  - **Cause**: Hooks are called conditionally.
  - **Solution**: Ensure hooks are called at the top level of the component.

- **Symptom**: Stale state in `useEffect`
  - **Cause**: Missing dependencies in the dependency array.
  - **Solution**: Review and add necessary dependencies to the array.

- **Symptom**: Performance issues in components
  - **Cause**: Excessive re-renders due to state updates.
  - **Solution**: Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to memoize values and functions.

- **Symptom**: API call fails
  - **Cause**: Incorrect URL or network issues.
  - **Solution**: Verify the API endpoint and check network status.

- **Symptom**: Form validation not triggering
  - **Cause**: Validation logic not executed.
  - **Solution**: Ensure validation is called in the appropriate lifecycle method.

- **Symptom**: Memory leaks in hooks
  - **Cause**: Not cleaning up subscriptions or event listeners.
  - **Solution**: Return a cleanup function from `useEffect`.

- **Symptom**: Unexpected behavior in state updates
  - **Cause**: Incorrect usage of `useState` or `useReducer`.
  - **Solution**: Review state update logic for correctness.
