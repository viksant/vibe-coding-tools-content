### Tool Benefits
**Performance Optimizer** provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools to analyze application performance. Key benefits include:
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Automatically detects performance bottlenecks in code execution.
- **Memory Leak Detection**: Identifies memory leaks that can degrade application performance over time.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Offers specific optimization suggestions based on real-time analysis.
- **Benchmarking**: Measures performance improvements before and after optimizations.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks performance metrics to ensure applications run efficiently.

### Setup & Installation
#### Installation Steps
1. **For Windows:**
   - Download the installer from the official website.
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   - Add the installation directory to your system's `PATH` variable.

2. **For macOS:**
   - Use Homebrew to install:
     ```bash
     brew install performance-optimizer
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the `.dmg` file and drag the application to your Applications folder.

3. **For Linux:**
   - Use the package manager for your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install performance-optimizer
     ```
   - Or download the tarball and extract it:
     ```bash
     tar -xzf performance-optimizer.tar.gz
     cd performance-optimizer
     ./install.sh
     ```

### Configuration
#### Essential Configuration Options
- **Configuration File**: Located at `~/.performance-optimizer/config.json`. Key options include:
  - `"monitoring_interval"`: Set the interval for performance monitoring (default: `5s`).
  - `"log_level"`: Set the logging level (`info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`).
  
Example configuration:
```json
{
  "monitoring_interval": "5s",
  "log_level": "info"
}
```

- **Environment Variables**: Set the following environment variables for custom behavior:
  - `PO_API_KEY`: Your API key for accessing advanced features.
  - `PO_ENABLE_LOGGING`: Set to `true` to enable detailed logging.

### Usage Guide
#### Basic Commands
- **Start Monitoring**:
  ```bash
  performance-optimizer start
  ```
- **Stop Monitoring**:
  ```bash
  performance-optimizer stop
  ```
- **View Reports**:
  ```bash
  performance-optimizer report
  ```

#### Practical Example
To analyze a Node.js application:
1. Start the application with the performance optimizer:
   ```bash
   performance-optimizer start node app.js
   ```
2. After running the application, stop monitoring:
   ```bash
   performance-optimizer stop
   ```
3. Generate a report:
   ```bash
   performance-optimizer report
   ```

### Advanced Features
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate Performance Optimizer into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure performance checks on every build.
- **Custom Metrics**: Define custom metrics to monitor specific application behaviors.
- **AI Recommendations**: Leverage AI-driven suggestions for optimizing complex code patterns.

### Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Performance Optimizer fails to start.
  - **Solution**: Ensure that the application has the necessary permissions and that the installation directory is in your `PATH`.

- **Issue**: Reports are not generated.
  - **Solution**: Check the log files located in `~/.performance-optimizer/logs` for errors.

### Best Practices
- Regularly update the Performance Optimizer to benefit from the latest features and bug fixes.
- Use the tool in a staging environment before deploying changes to production.
- Monitor performance metrics during peak usage times to identify potential issues.
- Combine Performance Optimizer with other profiling tools for a comprehensive analysis.
