### Usage Guide
- **Basic Code Completion**:
  - Start typing a function or variable name, and Ghostwriter will suggest completions. For example, typing `def my_function(` will prompt suggestions for parameters.
  
```python
def my_function(param1, param2):
    # Ghostwriter can suggest the body of the function
```
