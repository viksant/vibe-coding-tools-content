### Configuration
- **JDK Setup**: Configure the JDK by navigating to `File > Project Structure > Project`, and select the appropriate JDK version.
- **Editor Settings**: Customize editor preferences under `File > Settings > Editor`, adjusting font size, color schemes, and code style.
- **Version Control**: Set up version control integration by going to `File > Settings > Version Control`, and add your repository.

### Usage Guide
- **Creating a New Project**: 
   1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA and select `New Project`.
   2. Choose the project type (e.g., Java, Kotlin) and configure the project SDK.
   3. Follow the prompts to set up the project structure.

- **Running a Java Application**:
   1. Write your Java code in the editor.
   2. Right-click the file and select `Run 'YourClassName'`.
   3. View output in the Run tool window.

- **Using Version Control**:
   1. Initialize a Git repository via `VCS > Enable Version Control Integration`.
   2. Commit changes using `VCS > Commit`.
   3. Push changes to a remote repository via `VCS > Git > Push`.

### Advanced Features
- **Live Templates**: Create reusable code snippets by navigating to `File > Settings > Editor > Live Templates`.
- **Code Analysis**: Use `Code > Inspect Code` to analyze your project for potential issues.
- **Database Tools**: Connect to databases directly within the IDE using the Database tool window.

### Troubleshooting
- **IDE Performance Issues**: Increase memory allocation by editing the `idea.vmoptions` file. Add:
   ```
   -Xms512m
   -Xmx2048m
   ```
- **Plugin Compatibility Issues**: Disable or uninstall problematic plugins via `File > Settings > Plugins`.
- **Project Not Building**: Ensure the correct SDK is set and dependencies are properly configured in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

### Best Practices
- **Use Version Control**: Always use Git or another version control system for tracking changes.
- **Regularly Refactor Code**: Utilize IntelliJ's refactoring tools to maintain clean and efficient code.
- **Leverage Plugins**: Explore and install plugins that enhance your workflow, such as Lombok or CheckStyle.
- **Customize Shortcuts**: Familiarize yourself with keyboard shortcuts to speed up your development process. Access shortcuts via `Help > Keymap Reference`.
