- **Editor Settings**: Tailor your editor preferences under `File > Settings > Editor`, adjusting the font size, color schemes, and code style to your liking.
- **Version Control**: Integrate version control by navigating to `File > Settings > Version Control`, and add your repository.

### Usage Guide
- **Creating a New Project**: 
   1. Open IntelliJ IDEA and choose `New Project`.
   2. Select the project type (e.g., Java, Kotlin) and configure the project SDK.
   3. Follow the prompts to set up your project structure.

- **Running a Java Application**:
   1. Write your Java code in the editor.
   2. Right-click the file and choose `Run 'YourClassName'`.
   3. Check the output in the Run tool window.

- **Using Version Control**:
   1. Start a Git repository by going to `VCS > Enable Version Control Integration`.
   2. Commit your changes using `VCS > Commit`.
   3. Push changes to a remote repository via `VCS > Git > Push`.

### Advanced Features
- **Live Templates**: Create reusable code snippets by navigating to `File > Settings > Editor > Live Templates`.
- **Code Analysis**: Use `Code > Inspect Code` to check your project for potential issues.
- **Database Tools**: Connect to databases directly within the IDE using the Database tool window.

### Troubleshooting
- **IDE Performance Issues**: If you're experiencing slowness, increase memory allocation by editing the `idea.vmoptions` file. Add the following lines:
   ```
   -Xms512m
   -Xmx2048m
   ```
- **Plugin Compatibility Issues**: If you run into issues with plugins, disable or uninstall the problematic ones via `File > Settings > Plugins`.
- **Project Not Building**: Make sure you have the correct SDK set and that dependencies are properly configured in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

### Best Practices
- **Use Version Control**: Always track changes using Git or another version control system.
- **Regularly Refactor Code**: Take advantage of IntelliJ's refactoring tools to keep your code clean and efficient.
- **Leverage Plugins**: Explore and install plugins that can boost your workflow, such as Lombok or CheckStyle.
- **Customize Shortcuts**: Get familiar with keyboard shortcuts to speed up your development process. You can find shortcuts under `Help > Keymap Reference`.
