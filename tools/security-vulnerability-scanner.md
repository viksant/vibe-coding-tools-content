### Tool Benefits
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Scans codebases for a wide range of vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, and authentication bypasses.
- **OWASP Compliance**: Aligns with the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, ensuring critical security issues are addressed.
- **Remediation Guidance**: Provides actionable recommendations for fixing identified vulnerabilities.
- **Automated Scanning**: Integrates into CI/CD pipelines for continuous security assessment.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with multiple programming languages and frameworks.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the following installed:
  - Java (JDK 8 or higher)
  - Node.js (for JavaScript projects)
  - Python (for Python projects)

#### Installation Steps
1. **Download the Scanner**:
   - Visit the official website and download the latest version of the Security Vulnerability Scanner.
  
2. **Install via Package Manager**:
   - For **npm**:
     ```bash
     npm install -g security-vulnerability-scanner
     ```
   - For **pip**:
     ```bash
     pip install security-vulnerability-scanner
     ```

3. **Extract the Package** (if downloaded as a zip):
   ```bash
   unzip security-vulnerability-scanner.zip -d /path/to/installation
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   security-vulnerability-scanner --version
   ```

### Configuration
- **Configuration File**: Create a configuration file named `scanner-config.json` in your project root.
```json
{
  "scanPaths": ["src/", "lib/"],
  "outputFormat": "json",
  "enableRemediation": true,
  "excludePatterns": ["node_modules/", "vendor/"]
}
```
- **Key Configuration Options**:
  - `scanPaths`: Directories to scan for vulnerabilities.
  - `outputFormat`: Choose between `json`, `xml`, or `text`.
  - `enableRemediation`: Set to `true` to receive remediation suggestions.
  - `excludePatterns`: Patterns for files or directories to exclude from scanning.

### Usage Guide
- **Basic Scan Command**:
```bash
security-vulnerability-scanner --config scanner-config.json
```
- **Scan a Specific File**:
```bash
security-vulnerability-scanner scan src/app.js
```
- **View Results**:
```bash
cat results.json
```
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Add the following command to your CI/CD pipeline script:
```bash
security-vulnerability-scanner --config scanner-config.json --output results.json
```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Rules**: Define custom vulnerability rules in `custom-rules.json`.
- **Integration with IDEs**: Use plugins available for popular IDEs like VSCode and IntelliJ for real-time scanning.
- **Scheduled Scans**: Use cron jobs to schedule regular scans:
```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/security-vulnerability-scanner --config /path/to/scanner-config.json
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Scanner Not Found**: Ensure the installation path is in your system's `PATH` variable.
  - **Permission Denied**: Run the command with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues.
  - **Configuration Errors**: Validate your JSON configuration file using a JSON linter.

### Best Practices
- Regularly update the scanner to benefit from the latest vulnerability definitions.
- Integrate scanning into your development workflow to catch vulnerabilities early.
- Review and address vulnerabilities in a timely manner to maintain code security.
- Use the remediation guidance provided to fix issues effectively.
- Maintain a clean codebase by excluding unnecessary directories from scans.
