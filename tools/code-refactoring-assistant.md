- **Improved Maintainability**: Automatically detects code smells and suggests refactoring opportunities, making code easier to maintain.
- **Enhanced Readability**: Offers suggestions to improve code clarity, which benefits both current and future developers.
- **Design Patterns**: Helps implement design patterns effectively, promoting best practices in software architecture.
- **Automated Refactoring**: Reduces manual effort by automating the extraction of methods and classes, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Works with multiple programming languages, making it versatile for diverse development environments.

### Setup & Installation
#### For Visual Studio Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side.
3. Search for "Code Refactoring Assistant".
4. Click **Install** on the extension page.

#### For IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins`.
3. Search for "Code Refactoring Assistant".
4. Click **Install** and restart the IDE.

#### For Command Line Interface (CLI)
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Run the following command to install globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g code-refactoring-assistant
   ```

### Configuration
After installation, configure the tool to suit your project needs:
- **Configuration File**: Create a `.refactor.config.json` in your project root with the following structure:
  ```json
  {
    "rules": {
      "detect-code-smells": true,
      "suggest-extraction": true,
      "enforce-design-patterns": true
    }
  }
  ```
- **Editor Settings**: Adjust settings in your IDE to enable automatic suggestions and alerts for detected issues.

### Usage Guide
To effectively use the Code Refactoring Assistant:
- **Analyze Code**: Open a file in your IDE and trigger the analysis. For CLI, run:
  ```bash
  refactor analyze src/
  ```
- **View Suggestions**: Suggestions will appear inline or in a dedicated panel. Click on a suggestion to apply it.
- **Refactor Code**: To apply a specific refactoring suggestion, use:
  ```bash
  refactor apply <suggestion-id>
  ```

### Advanced Features
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate the tool into your CI/CD pipeline by adding a step in your build configuration:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Code Refactoring Assistant
      run: refactor analyze src/
  ```
- **Custom Rules**: Define custom rules in your `.refactor.config.json` to tailor the analysis to your project's specific needs.

### Troubleshooting
- **Issue: Suggestions not appearing**: Ensure the tool is enabled in your IDE settings and that your project is properly configured.
- **Issue: Command not found**: Verify that the tool is installed globally and that your PATH includes the installation directory.
- **Issue: Performance lag**: Reduce the scope of analysis by specifying a directory or file:
  ```bash
  refactor analyze src/components/
  ```

### Best Practices
- Regularly run the refactoring tool on your codebase to catch issues early.
- Use the tool in conjunction with code reviews to ensure code quality.
- Keep your configuration file updated as your project evolves to reflect new coding standards and practices.
- Encourage team members to familiarize themselves with the tool to maintain a consistent code quality across the project.
