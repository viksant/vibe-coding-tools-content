### Tool Benefits
The **Security Scanner** provides automated vulnerability detection, ensuring that codebases are free from security threats and compliance violations. Key benefits include:
- **Automated Scanning**: Quickly identifies vulnerabilities in codebases without manual intervention.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors applications for new vulnerabilities, ensuring ongoing compliance.
- **Remediation Guidance**: Offers actionable recommendations for fixing identified issues, streamlining the security audit process.
- **Compliance Assurance**: Helps maintain adherence to industry standards such as OWASP, PCI-DSS, and GDPR.
- **Integration Capabilities**: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines, enhancing security during the development lifecycle.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (version 12 or higher).
- Install **npm** (Node Package Manager) which comes with Node.js.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Global Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g security-scanner
   ```
2. **Local Installation** (for specific projects):
   ```bash
   npm install security-scanner --save-dev
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   security-scanner --version
   ```

### Configuration
#### Configuration File
Create a `.scanner-config.json` file in your project root with the following structure:
```json
{
  "scan": {
    "paths": ["src", "lib"],
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "test"],
    "rules": {
      "high": true,
      "medium": true,
      "low": false
    }
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "json",
    "path": "./reports/security-report.json"
  }
}
```
- **paths**: Directories to scan.
- **exclude**: Directories to ignore during the scan.
- **rules**: Set severity levels to include in the scan results.
- **output**: Specify the output format and path for reports.

### Usage Guide
#### Basic Scanning Command
To perform a scan, run:
```bash
security-scanner scan
```
This command will use the configuration file to scan the specified paths.

#### Viewing Reports
After scanning, view the generated report:
```bash
cat ./reports/security-report.json
```

#### CI/CD Integration
To integrate with CI/CD pipelines, add the following command to your build script:
```bash
security-scanner scan --fail-on-vulnerabilities
```
This will fail the build if vulnerabilities are detected.

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Rules**: Define your own rules in the configuration file to tailor the scanning process to your project's needs.
- **Integration with GitHub Actions**: Use the following YAML snippet in your GitHub Actions workflow:
  ```yaml
  jobs:
    security-scan:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: Install Security Scanner
          run: npm install -g security-scanner
        - name: Run Security Scan
          run: security-scanner scan
  ```
- **Scheduled Scans**: Set up cron jobs to run scans at regular intervals for continuous monitoring.

### Troubleshooting
- **Command Not Found**: Ensure that the installation path is included in your system's `PATH` variable.
- **Permission Denied**: Run the command with `sudo` if you encounter permission issues on Unix-based systems.
- **Configuration Errors**: Validate your `.scanner-config.json` file using JSON linting tools to ensure proper syntax.

### Best Practices
- **Regular Scans**: Schedule scans regularly to catch vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- **Review Reports**: Always review scan reports and prioritize fixing high and medium severity vulnerabilities.
- **Integrate with Development Workflow**: Incorporate security scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure security checks are part of the development lifecycle.
- **Stay Updated**: Keep the Security Scanner updated to benefit from the latest vulnerability definitions and improvements. Use:
  ```bash
  npm update -g security-scanner
  ```
