### Tool Benefits
The **Database Query Optimizer** provides several key advantages for developers:

- **Performance Analysis**: Automatically analyzes queries to identify performance bottlenecks, allowing developers to focus on critical issues.
- **Index Optimization**: Suggests optimal indexing strategies to improve query execution times, reducing database load.
- **Query Restructuring**: Recommends modifications to queries for better performance, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
- **Execution Plan Insights**: Offers detailed execution plan analysis, helping developers understand how queries are processed by the database.
- **Cross-Database Support**: Works with multiple database systems (SQL and NoSQL), making it versatile for various projects.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Java 11 or higher installed.
- Supported databases must be installed and accessible.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Download the Tool**:
   - Visit the official website and download the latest version of the Database Query Optimizer.

2. **Install on Windows**:
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
   - Add the installation directory to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

3. **Install on macOS**:
   - Use Homebrew to install:
     ```bash
     brew install database-query-optimizer
     ```

4. **Install on Linux**:
   - Extract the downloaded tarball:
     ```bash
     tar -xzf database-query-optimizer.tar.gz
     ```
   - Move to `/usr/local/bin`:
     ```bash
     sudo mv database-query-optimizer /usr/local/bin/
     ```

### Configuration
#### Essential Configuration Options
- **Database Connection**: Configure your database connection settings in the `config.yaml` file.
  ```yaml
  database:
    type: "postgresql" # or "mysql", "mongodb", "sqlite"
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5432
    username: "your_username"
    password: "your_password"
    database_name: "your_database"
  ```

- **Optimization Level**: Set the optimization level to control the aggressiveness of suggestions.
  ```yaml
  optimization_level: "high" # options: low, medium, high
  ```

### Usage Guide
#### Basic Command
To analyze a query, use the following command:
```bash
database-query-optimizer analyze "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30;"
```

#### Example Workflow
1. **Analyze a Query**:
   ```bash
   database-query-optimizer analyze "SELECT name, email FROM customers WHERE purchase_date > '2023-01-01';"
   ```
2. **View Recommendations**: After analysis, recommendations will be displayed, including suggested indexes and query restructuring.

3. **Apply Suggestions**: Use the provided SQL commands to apply the suggested optimizations.

### Advanced Features
- **Batch Analysis**: Analyze multiple queries at once by providing a file with queries:
  ```bash
  database-query-optimizer batch-analyze queries.sql
  ```
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate the optimizer in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically analyze queries during deployment.

### Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your database is running and accessible. Check firewall settings and credentials.
- **Slow Performance**: If the tool is slow, consider increasing the memory allocation in the `config.yaml`:
  ```yaml
  memory_allocation: "2G" # Adjust based on your system capacity
  ```

### Best Practices
- Regularly analyze queries during development to catch performance issues early.
- Use the tool's recommendations to maintain optimal database performance.
- Integrate query optimization checks in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing performance improvements.
- Document any changes made based on the tool's suggestions for future reference.
