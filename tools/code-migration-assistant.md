### Tool Benefits
The **Code Migration Assistant** simplifies the process of upgrading codebases to newer language versions, frameworks, or platforms. Key benefits include:
- **Automated Analysis**: Identifies compatibility issues and deprecated features in your code.
- **Modern Alternatives**: Suggests up-to-date replacements for outdated constructs and libraries.
- **Step-by-Step Migration Plans**: Provides a structured approach to migration, reducing manual effort.
- **Safety Validations**: Ensures that code transformations do not introduce new bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with multiple programming languages and frameworks, making it versatile for various projects.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the following installed:
  - **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
  - **npm** (Node Package Manager)

#### Installation Steps
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Install the Code Migration Assistant globally using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g code-migration-assistant
   ```
3. Verify the installation by checking the version:
   ```bash
   code-migration-assistant --version
   ```

### Configuration
#### Configuration File
Create a configuration file named `migration-config.json` in your project root. Hereâ€™s a basic template:
```json
{
  "sourceLanguage": "JavaScript",
  "targetLanguage": "TypeScript",
  "options": {
    "autoFix": true,
    "backup": true,
    "verbose": false
  }
}
```
- **sourceLanguage**: The language of your current codebase.
- **targetLanguage**: The language or framework you want to migrate to.
- **autoFix**: Automatically apply suggested fixes (true/false).
- **backup**: Create a backup of the original files before migration (true/false).
- **verbose**: Enable detailed logging during migration (true/false).

### Usage Guide
#### Basic Migration Command
To start the migration process, run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
code-migration-assistant migrate --config migration-config.json
```
#### Example Workflow
1. Analyze your codebase for compatibility:
   ```bash
   code-migration-assistant analyze --config migration-config.json
   ```
2. Review the suggested changes and migration plan.
3. Execute the migration:
   ```bash
   code-migration-assistant migrate --config migration-config.json
   ```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Rules**: Define custom migration rules in your configuration file to handle specific cases.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate the migration tool into your CI/CD pipeline to automate migration checks on every build.
- **Rollback Feature**: If issues arise post-migration, use the rollback feature to revert to the backup:
  ```bash
  code-migration-assistant rollback --config migration-config.json
  ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Error: "Unsupported language"**: Ensure that the specified `sourceLanguage` and `targetLanguage` in your configuration file are supported.
- **Migration fails with "syntax error"**: Check your code for syntax issues before running the migration.
- **Backup not created**: Verify that you have write permissions in the project directory.

### Best Practices
- **Backup Before Migration**: Always enable the backup option to prevent data loss.
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate in smaller increments rather than all at once to isolate issues more effectively.
- **Review Changes**: After migration, carefully review the transformed code for any necessary manual adjustments.
- **Test Thoroughly**: Run your test suite after migration to catch any regressions or issues introduced during the process.
