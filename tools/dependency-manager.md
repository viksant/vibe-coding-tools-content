### Tool Benefits
- **Automated Dependency Management**: Automatically identifies and updates outdated packages, reducing manual effort.
- **Security Vulnerability Detection**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, helping to maintain secure applications.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Ensures that updated packages are compatible with the existing codebase, minimizing breakage.
- **License Compliance Monitoring**: Tracks licenses of dependencies to ensure compliance with project policies.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Can be integrated into continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated checks.

### Setup & Installation
#### Node.js Environment
1. Ensure Node.js is installed. Check with:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```
2. Install the Dependency Manager globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g dependency-manager
   ```

#### Python Environment
1. Ensure Python is installed. Check with:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Install using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install dependency-manager
   ```

#### Ruby Environment
1. Ensure Ruby is installed. Check with:
   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```
2. Install using gem:
   ```bash
   gem install dependency-manager
   ```

### Configuration
- **Configuration File**: Create a `.dependency-manager.json` file in your project root.
- **Basic Configuration Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "checkForUpdates": true,
    "vulnerabilityScan": true,
    "licenseCompliance": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedLicenses": ["MIT", "Apache-2.0"]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Custom Settings**: Modify the configuration file to include specific package sources or ignore certain packages.

### Usage Guide
- **Check for Updates**: Run the following command to check for outdated dependencies:
  ```bash
  dependency-manager check-updates
  ```
- **Update Dependencies**: To update all dependencies to their latest versions:
  ```bash
  dependency-manager update
  ```
- **Scan for Vulnerabilities**: To perform a security scan:
  ```bash
  dependency-manager scan
  ```
- **Generate Compliance Report**: To create a report on license compliance:
  ```bash
  dependency-manager compliance-report
  ```

### Advanced Features
- **Automated Updates**: Set up a cron job to automatically run updates weekly:
  ```bash
  0 0 * * 0 dependency-manager update
  ```
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Add the following to your CI configuration file:
  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Check Dependencies
      run: dependency-manager check-updates
    - name: Run Security Scan
      run: dependency-manager scan
  ```
- **Custom Scripts**: Create custom scripts in your `package.json`:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "update-dependencies": "dependency-manager update",
    "check-security": "dependency-manager scan"
  }
  ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Installation Errors**: Ensure you have the correct permissions. Use `sudo` if necessary.
  - **Dependency Conflicts**: Review the output logs for specific package conflicts and resolve them manually.
  - **Vulnerability Scans Not Running**: Check if the configuration file has `vulnerabilityScan` set to `true`.

### Best Practices
- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular updates to keep dependencies current and secure.
- **Review Change Logs**: Always review the change logs of updated packages for breaking changes.
- **Use Version Ranges**: Specify version ranges in your configuration to avoid unexpected major updates.
- **Monitor Dependencies**: Use the tool in conjunction with other monitoring tools to maintain a healthy codebase.
