Create a configuration file named `.formatterconfig.json` in the root of your project:
```json
{
  "tabWidth": 4,
  "useTabs": false,
  "semi": true,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5"
}
```
#### Recommended Settings
- **tabWidth**: Set to `2` or `4` based on team preferences.
- **useTabs**: Use spaces or tabs as per the coding standards.
- **semi**: Choose whether to add semicolons at the end of statements.
- **singleQuote**: Prefer single quotes over double quotes for strings.

### Usage Guide
#### Formatting Files
To format a single file:
```bash
code-formatter-pro path/to/your/file.js
```
To format all files in a directory:
```bash
code-formatter-pro .
```
#### Integrating with Git Hooks
To ensure code is formatted before commits, add a pre-commit hook:
1. Install `husky`:
   ```bash
   npm install husky --save-dev
   ```
2. Add the hook in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "husky": {
     "hooks": {
       "pre-commit": "code-formatter-pro ."
     }
   }
   ```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Plugins**: Extend functionality with custom plugins for specific frameworks.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Add formatting checks in your CI/CD pipeline to enforce code style.
- **Editor Integration**: Configure your IDE (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ) to format code on save.

### Troubleshooting
- **Issue: Formatting not applied**
  - Ensure the configuration file is correctly named and located in the project root.
- **Issue: Errors during formatting**
  - Check for syntax errors in the code being formatted.
- **Issue: Conflicts with other formatters**
  - Disable other formatters in your IDE to avoid conflicts.

### Best Practices
- **Consistent Configuration**: Share the configuration file across the team to maintain consistency.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep the tool updated to leverage new features and fixes.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Use pre-commit hooks to automate formatting checks before code is committed.
- **Documentation**: Document the formatting rules and rationale in your projectâ€™s README for new team members.
