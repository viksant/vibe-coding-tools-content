### Tool Benefits
The **Component Library Generator** streamlines the process of creating reusable UI components, enabling developers to focus on building applications rather than repetitive tasks. Key benefits include:
- **Automated Code Generation**: Quickly generates component code from design specifications, reducing manual coding effort.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Automatically creates usage documentation and examples, ensuring that components are easy to understand and implement.
- **Interactive Playground**: Provides a live environment for testing components, enhancing developer experience and collaboration.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Automatically checks components against accessibility standards, promoting inclusivity.
- **Design Token Support**: Facilitates the use of design tokens for consistent theming across applications.

### Setup & Installation
To install the Component Library Generator, follow these steps based on your environment:

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm or yarn

#### Installation Steps
1. **Global Installation**: Install the generator globally using npm or yarn:
   ```bash
   npm install -g component-library-generator
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn global add component-library-generator
   ```

2. **Create a New Project**: Initialize a new component library project:
   ```bash
   component-library-generator init my-component-library
   ```

3. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-component-library
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Configuration
Essential configuration options can be set in the `config.json` file located in the root of your project. Key configurations include:

- **Component Path**: Specify the directory for your components:
  ```json
  "componentPath": "./src/components"
  ```
- **Documentation Path**: Set the output directory for documentation:
  ```json
  "documentationPath": "./docs"
  ```
- **Design Tokens**: Define design tokens for theming:
  ```json
  "designTokens": {
    "color": {
      "primary": "#007bff",
      "secondary": "#6c757d"
    }
  }
  ```

### Usage Guide
To effectively use the Component Library Generator, follow these practical examples:

1. **Generate a New Component**:
   ```bash
   component-library-generator generate component Button
   ```

2. **Build Documentation**: After creating components, generate documentation:
   ```bash
   component-library-generator build-docs
   ```

3. **Run Interactive Playground**: Start the interactive playground to test components:
   ```bash
   component-library-generator playground
   ```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Templates**: Create custom templates for components to standardize structure across your library.
- **Integration with Storybook**: Easily integrate with Storybook for enhanced component visualization and testing.
- **Theming Support**: Utilize design tokens to implement theming, allowing for easy customization of component styles.

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions include:

- **Error: Command Not Found**: Ensure the generator is installed globally and your PATH is set correctly.
- **Documentation Not Generating**: Check the `config.json` for correct paths and ensure components are properly defined.
- **Accessibility Tests Failing**: Review component markup and ensure compliance with accessibility standards.

### Best Practices
- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use clear and consistent naming for components to improve maintainability.
- **Modular Components**: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces to enhance flexibility.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and the generator itself updated to leverage new features and improvements.
- **Documentation First**: Write documentation alongside component development to ensure clarity and completeness.
