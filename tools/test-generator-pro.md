- **Improved Software Quality**: Helps identify potential bugs early in the development cycle, leading to more robust applications.
- **Time Efficiency**: Saves time in writing tests, allowing developers to focus on feature development and other critical tasks.
- **Supports Multiple Languages**: Works seamlessly with various programming languages, making it versatile for different projects.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management (if applicable)

#### Installation Steps
1. **Download the Tool**:
   - Visit the official website and download the latest version of Test Generator Pro.

2. **Install via Package Manager** (for Linux users):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install test-generator-pro
   ```

3. **Install via Homebrew** (for macOS users):
   ```bash
   brew install test-generator-pro
   ```

4. **Manual Installation**:
   - Unzip the downloaded file to your desired directory.
   - Add the `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` variable:
     - For Linux/Mac:
       ```bash
       export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/test-generator-pro/bin
       ```
     - For Windows:
       - Add the path to the `bin` directory in the System Environment Variables.

5. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   test-generator-pro --version
   ```

### Configuration
#### Configuration File
- Create a configuration file named `test-generator-config.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "outputDirectory": "tests/",
  "testFramework": "JUnit",
  "language": "Java",
  "includeEdgeCases": true,
  "coverageThreshold": 80
}
```
- **Key Configuration Options**:
  - `outputDirectory`: Directory where generated tests will be saved.
  - `testFramework`: Specify the testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Mocha).
  - `language`: Programming language of the codebase.
  - `includeEdgeCases`: Boolean to include edge case scenarios.
  - `coverageThreshold`: Minimum code coverage percentage to aim for.

### Usage Guide
#### Basic Command
To generate tests, run the following command in your project directory:
```bash
test-generator-pro generate --config test-generator-config.json
```
#### Example Workflow
1. **Generate Tests**:
   ```bash
   test-generator-pro generate --config test-generator-config.json
   ```
2. **Run Generated Tests**:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```
3. **Review Coverage Report**:
   - Check the coverage report generated in the `tests/` directory.

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Test Templates**: Create custom templates for specific test cases.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate with Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate test generation on each commit.
- **Command-Line Options**: Use flags such as `--dry-run` to preview test cases before generation.

### Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: Command not found error.
  - **Solution**: Ensure the `bin` directory is correctly added to your `PATH`.
  
- **Issue**: Tests not generating.
  - **Solution**: Check the configuration file for errors and ensure the specified language and framework are supported.

- **Issue**: Low coverage report.
  - **Solution**: Adjust `coverageThreshold` in the configuration file and regenerate tests.

### Best Practices
- **Regularly Update**: Keep Test Generator Pro updated to leverage new features and improvements.
- **Review Generated Tests**: Always review generated tests for relevance and accuracy.
- **Integrate Early**: Incorporate test generation early in the development process to catch issues sooner.
- **Use Version Control**: Track changes in generated tests using version control systems like Git for better collaboration.
