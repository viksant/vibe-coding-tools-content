### Tool Benefits
- **Automated Test Creation**: Generates unit tests and integration tests automatically, saving time and reducing manual effort.
- **High Code Coverage**: Ensures comprehensive test coverage by identifying edge cases and potential failure points.
- **Multiple Framework Support**: Compatible with various testing frameworks such as JUnit, NUnit, Mocha, and PyTest, enabling seamless integration into existing projects.
- **Improved Code Reliability**: Follows best practices in testing to enhance code maintainability and reliability.
- **Supports TDD**: Facilitates Test-Driven Development (TDD) by generating tests before code implementation.

### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `Node.js` installed for JavaScript environments.
- For Python, ensure you have `Python 3.x` installed.

#### Installation Steps
1. **For Node.js**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g test-generator
   ```
2. **For Python**:
   ```bash
   pip install test-generator
   ```
3. **For Java**:
   Download the latest JAR from the [official repository](https://example.com/download) and run:
   ```bash
   java -jar test-generator.jar
   ```

### Configuration
- **Configuration File**: Create a `test-generator-config.json` file in your project root.
- **Example Configuration**:
  ```json
  {
    "framework": "mocha",
    "outputDir": "./tests",
    "coverageThreshold": 80,
    "includeEdgeCases": true
  }
  ```
- **Key Configuration Options**:
  - `framework`: Specifies the testing framework to use.
  - `outputDir`: Directory where generated tests will be saved.
  - `coverageThreshold`: Minimum coverage percentage required.
  - `includeEdgeCases`: Boolean to include edge cases in test generation.

### Usage Guide
- **Generate Tests**: Run the command to generate tests based on your source code.
  ```bash
  test-generator generate --source ./src --config ./test-generator-config.json
  ```
- **Run Generated Tests**: Use your testing framework's command to execute the tests.
  ```bash
  npm test  # For Mocha
  pytest    # For PyTest
  ```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Templates**: Create custom test templates for specific scenarios.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate test generation and execution.
- **Code Coverage Reports**: Generate detailed code coverage reports using built-in tools or third-party integrations.

### Troubleshooting
- **Issue: Tests Not Generating**: Ensure the source path is correct and the configuration file is properly formatted.
- **Issue: Low Coverage Reports**: Check the `coverageThreshold` setting and adjust your code or tests accordingly.
- **Issue: Compatibility Errors**: Verify that the correct testing framework is specified in the configuration.

### Best Practices
- **Regularly Update Configurations**: Keep your configuration file updated as your project evolves.
- **Review Generated Tests**: Always review and modify generated tests to ensure they meet your specific use cases.
- **Integrate with Version Control**: Commit your configuration and generated tests to version control to maintain consistency across environments.
- **Run Tests Frequently**: Incorporate test generation and execution into your daily development workflow to catch issues early.
