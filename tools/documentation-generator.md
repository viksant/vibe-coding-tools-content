### Setup & Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `Node.js` installed (for JavaScript-based tools).
- For Python-based tools, ensure you have `Python` and `pip` installed.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Using npm (JavaScript)**
   ```bash
   npm install -g documentation-generator
   ```
2. **Using pip (Python)**
   ```bash
   pip install documentation-generator
   ```
3. **Using Homebrew (macOS)**
   ```bash
   brew install documentation-generator
   ```
4. **From Source**
   - Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/documentation-generator.git
   ```
   - Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd documentation-generator
   ```
   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration
- **Configuration File**: Create a `.docgenrc` file in your project root to customize settings.
- **Example Configuration**:
```json
{
  "output": "docs/",
  "template": "default",
  "include": ["src/**/*.js", "lib/**/*.py"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules/**", "tests/**"],
  "title": "My Project Documentation"
}
```
- **Key Options**:
  - `output`: Directory for generated documentation.
  - `template`: Choose a predefined template or create a custom one.
  - `include`: Specify file patterns to include.
  - `exclude`: Specify file patterns to exclude.

### Usage Guide
- **Basic Command**: To generate documentation, run:
```bash
docgen generate
```
- **Generate Specific Documentation**: For API documentation only:
```bash
docgen generate --type api
```
- **Watch Mode**: Automatically regenerate documentation on file changes:
```bash
docgen generate --watch
```
- **Example Command**: To generate documentation with a custom output directory:
```bash
docgen generate --output docs/api
```

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Templates**: Create custom templates by modifying the default template files located in the `templates/` directory.
- **Integrations**: Integrate with CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate documentation generation on every commit.
- **Markdown Support**: Supports Markdown for README files, allowing for rich formatting and links.

### Troubleshooting
- **Common Issues**:
  - **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors about missing modules, ensure all dependencies are installed.
    - Solution: Run `npm install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - **Incorrect File Paths**: If documentation is not generated, check your `include` and `exclude` patterns in the configuration file.
    - Solution: Verify paths and adjust patterns accordingly.
  - **Permission Errors**: If you face permission issues on output directories.
    - Solution: Ensure you have write permissions or change the output directory.

### Best Practices
- **Comment Your Code**: Use clear and consistent comments in your code to improve the quality of generated documentation.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly regenerate documentation after significant code changes to keep it up to date.
- **Use Version Control**: Keep your `.docgenrc` and generated documentation under version control to track changes over time.
- **Review Generated Docs**: Always review the generated documentation for accuracy and completeness before publishing or sharing.
