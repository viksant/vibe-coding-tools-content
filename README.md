## ü§ù Contributing

Want to help out? We'd love your contributions! Pick one of these two ways:

### Option 1: Use the Platform (Recommended)

Use our **contribution system** right from the web app:

![Contribute Interface](contribute.png)

Here's how it works:

1. **Visit the Generate Page**: Go to `/generate` in the application
2. **Create with AI**: Use our content generator to make (on the /generate page):
   - Custom cursor rules and configurations
   - AI agents for specific development tasks
   - MCP server connections
   - Development templates and practices
3. **Generate Content**: Make high-quality, structured content with AI help
4. **Submit Form**: Submit your work using the `/contribute` form
5. **Manual Review**: Our team looks at and processes your submission by hand

### Option 2: Fork & Pull Request

Prefer the classic Git approach? Here you go:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cursor-directory-clone.git
   cd cursor-directory-clone
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution-name
   ```

3. **Add Your Content**
   - Put files in the right directory (`/agents`, `/configs`, `/mcps`, `/rules`, `/templates`, `/tips`, `/tools`)
   - Follow the file structure and naming that's already there
   - **MUST HAVE**: Include proper YAML frontmatter at the start of each `.md` file

   **Required YAML Frontmatter Example:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Content Title"
   description: "Brief description of what this does"
   category: "agents" # or configs, mcps, rules, templates, tips-tricks, tools
   tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
   tech_stack: ["react", "typescript"] # applicable technologies
   ---
   ```

   **Real Example:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Request API Security Best Practices"
   description: "Get secure API implementations with proper authentication and validation"
   category: "tips-tricks"
   tags: ["api", "security", "authentication", "validation", "jwt"]
   tech_stack: ["any"]
   ---
   ```

4. **Quality Standards**
   - **Expert-level technical accuracy**: Content should be production-ready
   - **Real-world focus**: Pick real use cases over theory
   - **Same formatting**: Follow existing markdown and YAML patterns
   - **Code examples**: Include working code snippets with context
   - **Right category**: Put content in the correct directory

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: [brief description of your contribution]"
   git push origin feature/your-contribution-name
   ```

6. **Review Process**
   - All contributions get **manually reviewed** by our team
   - We give feedback and suggestions for improvements
   - Accepted contributions get merged and deployed after human approval
