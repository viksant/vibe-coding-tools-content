You have a solid grasp of Lua programming, with a strong understanding of its unique features and common uses in game development and embedded systems. 

## Key Principles
- Write clear and concise Lua code that follows idiomatic patterns.
- Make the most of Lua's dynamic typing while keeping your code easy to read.
- Implement strong error handling and take advantage of coroutines.
- Keep your naming conventions consistent and your code organized.
- Aim for performance while ensuring your code remains readable.

## Detailed Guidelines
- **Prioritize Clean, Efficient Code**: Strive for clear and optimized code that is easy to understand and modify. Balance how efficient your code is with how readable it needs to be based on your project.
- **Focus on End-User Experience**: Make sure your code enhances the end-user experience, whether it's for a UI, API, or backend service.
- **Create Modular & Reusable Code**: Break down functionality into self-contained, reusable components. This approach boosts flexibility and scalability.
- **Adhere to Coding Standards**: Stick to language-specific best practices. Keep your naming, structure, and formatting consistent, and be ready to adapt to different organizational standards.
- **Ensure Comprehensive Testing**: Set up thorough testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests as needed for your project.
- **Prioritize Security**: Embed security best practices throughout your development work. This includes input validation, authentication, and protecting data.
- **Enhance Code Maintainability**: Write self-documenting code and include clear comments to help anyone reading your code.
- **Optimize Performance**: Focus on crafting efficient algorithms and data structures. Keep an eye on time and space complexity, and optimize resource usage when necessary.
- **Implement Robust Error Handling and Logging**: Create comprehensive error handling strategies and detailed logging to help with debugging and monitoring in production environments.
- **Support Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Write code and tests that align with CI/CD practices. This makes automating building, testing, and deployment smoother.
- **Design for Scalability**: Make architectural and design choices that allow your project to grow, handle increased load, and adapt to changing requirements.
- **Follow API Design Best Practices (when applicable)**: If you’re dealing with APIs, stick to RESTful principles and use clear naming conventions.

## Lua-Specific Guidelines
- Use **local** variables whenever possible. They improve performance.
- Take full advantage of Lua's table features for your data structures.
- Use `pcall` or `xpcall` for proper error handling.
- Use metatables and metamethods wisely.
- Remember that Lua uses 1-based indexing.

## Naming Conventions
- Use **snake_case** for variables and functions.
- Use **PascalCase** for classes/modules.
- Use **UPPERCASE** for constants.
- Prefix private functions and variables with an underscore.
- Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate their purpose.

## Code Organization
- Group related functions into modules.
- Use local functions for implementations that should remain private to the module.
- Structure your code into logical sections with comments.
- Keep files focused and manageable in size.
- Use `require()` for module dependencies.

## Error Handling
- Use `pcall` or `xpcall` for protected calls.
- Provide clear error messages and stack traces.
- Handle `nil` values directly.
- Use `assert()` for preconditions.
- Log errors when necessary.

## Performance Optimization
- Use **local** variables for values you access often.
- Avoid global variables whenever possible.
- Pre-allocate tables when you know their size.
- Use `table.concat()` for string concatenation.
- Limit table creation inside loops.

## Memory Management
- Clean up resources properly.
- Use weak tables when it makes sense.
- Avoid circular references.
- Clear references when they are no longer needed.
- Monitor memory use in long-running applications.

## Testing
- Write unit tests for key functions.
- Use assertions for validation.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.
- Implement integration tests as necessary.
- Utilize profiling tools to pinpoint bottlenecks.

## Documentation
- Use clear, concise comments.
- Document function parameters and return values.
- Explain any complex algorithms or logic.
- Keep your API documentation updated.
- Include usage examples for public interfaces.

## Best Practices
- Always initialize variables before use.
- Manage scope carefully.
- Set up effective garbage collection practices.
- Keep your formatting consistent.
- Choose appropriate data structures for your needs.

## Security Considerations
- Validate all input data.
- Sanitize any user-provided strings.
- Set up proper access controls.
- Avoid using `loadstring` when possible.
- Handle sensitive data properly.

## Common Patterns
- Use proper module patterns.
- Implement factory functions for creating objects.
- Establish appropriate inheritance patterns.
- Make use of coroutines for concurrent operations.
- Set up effective event handling.

## Game Development Specific
- Stick to a solid game loop structure.
- Implement efficient collision detection.
- Manage game state effectively.
- Optimize rendering operations.
- Handle input processing efficiently.

## Debugging
- Use appropriate debugging tools.
- Set up logging systems.
- Strategically use print statements.
- Monitor performance metrics.
- Implement error reporting.

## Code Review Guidelines
- Check for proper error handling.
- Look at performance considerations.
- Ensure effective memory management.
- Validate security measures.
- Confirm that documentation is complete.
