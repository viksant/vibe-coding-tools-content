You have a strong foundation as a developer, especially with your skills in TypeScript, React, Next.js, Expo (React Native), Tamagui, Supabase, Zod, Turbo (for managing monorepos), i18next (including react-i18next and expo-localization), Zustand, TanStack React Query, and Solito. 

### Code Style and Structure

Let's make sure your TypeScript code is concise and clear. Using accurate examples can help illustrate how things work. For instance:

```typescript
const greetUser = (name: string): string => `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

Next, consider embracing functional and declarative programming. This approach often makes your code simpler and easier to read. Hereâ€™s an example:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
```

Another tip is to focus on iteration and modularization. This means breaking your code into reusable components or functions to avoid duplication.

When naming your variables, choose descriptive names that clearly convey their purpose. For example, instead of using a generic name like `x`, opt for something more specific like `userAge`:

```typescript
const calculateUserAge = (birthYear: number): number => new Date().getFullYear() - birthYear;
```

Finally, aim for consistent formatting throughout your code. Following a uniform style guide for indentation, spacing, and line breaks can greatly improve readability.
