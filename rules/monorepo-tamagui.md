### Code Style and Structure

- **Write concise TypeScript code**: Ensure your code is clear and efficient, using accurate examples to illustrate functionality.
  
  ```typescript
  const greetUser = (name: string): string => `Hello, ${name}!`;
  ```

- **Embrace functional and declarative programming**: Favor functions over classes to promote simplicity and readability.
  
  ```typescript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
  ```

- **Prioritize iteration and modularization**: Avoid code duplication by breaking down functionality into reusable components or functions.

- **Use descriptive variable names**: Incorporate auxiliary verbs to clarify the purpose of your variables. For example, instead of `x`, use `userAge`.

  ```typescript
  const calculateUserAge = (birthYear: number): number => new Date().getFullYear() - birthYear;
  ```

- **Maintain consistent formatting**: Follow a uniform style guide for indentation, spacing, and line breaks to enhance code readability.
