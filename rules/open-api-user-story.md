### User Story Guidelines for Open API

When crafting user stories for Open API, adhere to the following best practices:

- **Identify Key Components**: Clearly define the user, their needs, and the expected outcome. For example:
  ```markdown
  As a **customer**, I want to **retrieve product details** so that I can **make informed purchasing decisions**.
  ```

- **Use Clear Language**: Ensure that the language used is straightforward and easily understandable. Avoid technical jargon unless necessary.

- **Prioritize User Needs**: Focus on what the user wants to achieve rather than how the system will implement it. This keeps the user story centered on the end goal.

- **Incorporate Acceptance Criteria**: Specify conditions that must be met for the user story to be considered complete. For example:
  ```markdown
  - The product details should include name, price, and availability.
  - The API response must return a status code of 200.
  ```

- **Keep It Concise**: User stories should be brief and to the point, typically no longer than a few sentences.

- **Utilize the INVEST Criteria**: Ensure that each user story is:
  - **Independent**: Can be developed and delivered separately.
  - **Negotiable**: Open to discussion and changes.
  - **Valuable**: Provides value to the user.
  - **Estimable**: Can be estimated for effort.
  - **Small**: Can be completed within a single iteration.
  - **Testable**: Can be validated through tests.

By following these guidelines, you can create effective user stories that enhance the clarity and usability of your Open API documentation.
