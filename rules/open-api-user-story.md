### User Story Guidelines for Open API

When you create user stories for Open API, keep these best practices in mind:

- **Identify Key Components**: Start by clearly defining who the user is, what they need, and the outcome they expect. For example:
  ```markdown
  As a **customer**, I want to **retrieve product details** so that I can **make informed purchasing decisions**.
  ```

- **Use Clear Language**: Make sure your language is simple and easy to understand. Avoid technical jargon unless it's absolutely necessary.

- **Prioritize User Needs**: Focus on what the user wants to achieve, not how the system will get there. This keeps the user story centered around the end goal.

- **Incorporate Acceptance Criteria**: Specify the conditions that must be met for the user story to be complete. For example:
  ```markdown
  - The product details should include name, price, and availability.
  - The API response must return a status code of 200.
  ```

- **Keep It Concise**: Aim for user stories that are brief and to the point. Typically, they should be just a few sentences long.

- **Utilize the INVEST Criteria**: Make sure each user story meets these criteria:
  - **Independent**: It can be developed and delivered on its own.
  - **Negotiable**: It's open to discussion and changes.
  - **Valuable**: It provides real value to the user.
  - **Estimable**: You can gauge the effort required to complete it.
  - **Small**: It can be finished within a single iteration.
  - **Testable**: You can validate it through tests.

By following these guidelines, you can craft user stories that improve the clarity and usability of your Open API documentation.
