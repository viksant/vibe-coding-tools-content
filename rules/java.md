You know your way around Java programming, Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Maven, JUnit, and other Java technologies. Let’s break down how to write great code and structure your projects effectively.

## Code Style and Structure
To start, focus on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented Java code. Use Spring Boot examples to guide you. Stick to Spring Boot best practices throughout your codebase. When developing web services, implement RESTful API design patterns. Choose descriptive method and variable names, and remember to follow the camelCase convention. It’s also a good idea to organize your Spring Boot applications into clear layers: controllers, services, repositories, models, and configurations.

## Spring Boot Specifics
Next, take advantage of Spring Boot starters for quick project setups and efficient dependency management. Apply annotations correctly, like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, and `@Service`. Don’t forget to use Spring Boot's auto-configuration features to simplify your setup. Robust exception handling is essential, so implement it using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.

## Naming Conventions
Naming conventions make your code easier to read. Use PascalCase for class names, such as `UserController` and `OrderService`. For methods and variables, use camelCase, like `findUserById` and `isOrderValid`. Constants should be in ALL_CAPS, such as `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` and `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`.

## Java and Spring Boot Usage
Leverage features from Java 17 or later, including records, sealed classes, and pattern matching. Make use of the best practices available in Spring Boot 3.x. For database operations, Spring Data JPA is a great tool. Also, implement validation using Bean Validation, with annotations like `@Valid` and custom validators.

## Configuration and Properties
When configuring your application, you can use `application.properties` or `application.yml`. Implement environment-specific configurations with Spring Profiles. For type-safe configuration properties, use `@ConfigurationProperties`.

## Dependency Injection and IoC
For dependency injection, prefer constructor injection over field injection. This approach improves testability. Take advantage of Spring's IoC container to manage bean lifecycles effectively.

## Testing
Testing is crucial. Write unit tests with JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test. Use MockMvc for testing web layers, and implement integration tests using `@SpringBootTest`. For repository layer testing, `@DataJpaTest` is your go-to.

## Performance and Scalability
For performance, consider implementing caching strategies with the Spring Cache abstraction. Use async processing with `@Async` for non-blocking operations. Don’t forget to optimize database performance through proper indexing and query optimization.

## Security
Security is non-negotiable. Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization. Ensure proper password encoding, like using BCrypt. If needed, configure CORS to manage cross-origin requests.

## Logging and Monitoring
For logging, use SLF4J with Logback. Set appropriate log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG. Utilize Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring your application and gathering metrics.

## API Documentation
For documenting your APIs, Springdoc OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) provides a comprehensive solution.

## Data Access and ORM
When it comes to database operations, Spring Data JPA is your friend. Make sure to establish proper entity relationships and cascading. Tools like Flyway or Liquibase can help you manage database migrations effectively.

## Build and Deployment
Use Maven for managing dependencies and your build process. Implement distinct profiles for different environments—development, testing, and production. If you’re considering containerization, Docker can be a useful tool.

Always follow best practices for RESTful API design, such as the correct use of HTTP methods and status codes. If you're working with microservices, keep those principles in mind. Consider utilizing asynchronous processing with Spring's `@Async` or reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.

Finally, adhere to SOLID principles to maintain high cohesion and low coupling in your Spring Boot application design. This approach will help you create clean, maintainable code.
