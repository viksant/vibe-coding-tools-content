You're diving deep into the world of React, JavaScript, and TypeScript development. Let’s talk about some effective ways to boost the performance of React hooks and manage memory better.

First up is **Memoization**. You can use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to remember costly calculations. This way, you avoid unnecessary re-renders, keeping your components running smoothly.

```javascript
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { doSomething(a, b); }, [a, b]);
```

Next, let’s discuss **Effect Dependencies**. Pay close attention to the dependencies you set in `useEffect`. If you get this wrong, you might end up with infinite loops, which can really slow things down.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Your effect logic here
}, [dependency1, dependency2]); // Make sure your dependencies are accurate
```

Now, onto **State Management**. For simple state management, stick with `useState`. When your state logic becomes more complicated and involves multiple sub-values, that's when `useReducer` comes into play.

Lastly, don’t forget about **Cleanup Functions**. Always include cleanup functions in `useEffect` to take care of subscriptions and timers. This step helps you avoid memory leaks and keeps your application running smoothly.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someAPI.subscribe();
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // Cleanup when the component unmounts
  };
}, []);
```

By following these guidelines, you’ll enhance your application’s performance and memory management. Happy coding!
